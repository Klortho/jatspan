     =============================================================

Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)

     =============================================================
     Version 2.3                       (DAL/BTU) v2.3 (2007-02-02)
     
     Enhancement Release (2.3) following the Working Group meetings 
     of Oct-Nov/2006-Jan/2007. No backward-incompatible changes.
     Archiving loosened even more. New structures for all the DTDs. 
     
  9. BOOK PART - Added an optional <book-meta> to the beginning
     of <book-part>, since book parts are sometimes processed
     separately. (The namespace for XLink was already there through
     the PE -%might-link-atts;.)
     
  8. NAMESPACES - Added the MathML namespace pseudo-attribute
     to <book-part>, as book parts are sometimes processed as
     separate objects.
     
  7. Updated public identifier to "v2.3 20070202//EN"          

     =============================================================
     Version 2.2                       (DAL/BTU) v2.2 (2006-10-13)
     Updated base Suite to latest version (2.2) Other minor
     modifications for processing.

  6. Created new element <book-part-categories> (and the PE for 
     its content model, %book-part-categories-model;) and added 
     this new element to content model of <book-part-meta> (via 
     addition to PE %book-part-meta-model;).

  5. BOOK PART - Changed the content model for the Book Part 
     (through the Parameter Entity %book-part-model;) to make
     <book-part-meta> optional. 
               
  4. Updated public identifier to "v2.3 20070202".

     =============================================================
     Version 2.1                       (DAL/BTU) v2.1 (2005-06-30)
     
     
     Changed to MathML 2.0 and MathML 2.0 Character Sets
          
  3. PERMISSIONS - Added a new <permissions> wrapper element to
     consolidate copyright and licensing information. For backwards
     compatibility, the new element will be added alongside the
     existing copyright elements. Best practice will be to use the
     new container, but <copyright-statement>, <copyright-year>,
     and <license> will be accepted in their old positions inside
     <book-part-meta>
      - Added <permissions> to <book-part-meta> model
      - Added <copyright-holder> to <permissions>

  2. Updated public identifier to "v2.3 20070202"

     =============================================================
     Version 2.0                    (DAL/BTU/TRG) v2.0 (2005-01-25)
     
  1. Comments for this module were cleaned up as part of the delivery 
     of the NCBI Historical DTD. Since only comments were changed,
     this was not even considered to be a dot release and the
     formal public identifier remained unchanged.                  -->

<!--                    One organizational unit of a book, typically 
                        called a chapter, but it might be a part, 
                        module, section, unit, topic, volume, etc.
                        Remarks: In this DTD, the word "section" is
                        defined for subunits of a <book-part> that are
                        just heads and text, they have no back matter
                        such as appendices and references. By this
                        DTD's definition, if a division of the
                        hierarchical text (in other words, not
                        something out of line like a sidebar) has 
                        formal back matter, then it is a <book-part>.
                        Remarks: The "book-part-type" attribute can
                        be used to name the published name of the
                        component, for text generation or other
                        purposes, for example:
                            <book-part part-type="chapter">
                        Book parts with the title "Part" typically
                        contain other <book-part>s. Book parts with
                        the title "Chapter" typically contain just
                        sections. The deciding factor is how much
                        metadata you need (chapter have only titles,
                        and book parts have a lot of metadata) and
                        whether or not there is formal back matter.
                        Book parts may have back matter; sections
                        may not.                                   -->

                        practice is to use values as defined in
                        RFC 1766, typically 2-letter language
                        codes such as "FR" (French), "EN" (English),
