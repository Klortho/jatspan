     Version 1.0 Post Publishing DTD Change (dal) v 1.0 2003-02-10

1.  Removed <other-ref>, since the Publishing (authoring) DTD did
    not need it and that is what it had been made for. It was never
    to be used for conversion or interchange, so its gone.
    Removed %other-ref-elements; as well. It did not need to be 
    removed from any context, as it was never used.
                                                                   -->

                        In an unstructured reference, this text would
                        merely be data characters.
                        Typical comments could include:
                          <comment>[Abstract]</comment>
                          <comment>translated from Russian</comment>
                        Design Note: The <comment> element is defined
                        here largely for the sake of conversion, to
                        preserve the semantic markup when translating
                        from other DTDs.
                        Authoring and Conversion Note: The Comment
                        element should be used to mark substantive
                        text only; it should NOT be used to markup
                        punctuation that occurs between elements.
                        Display Note: Comments should appear inline
