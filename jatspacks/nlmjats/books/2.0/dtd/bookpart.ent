<!--                    One organizational unit of a book, typically 
                        called a chapter, but it might be a part, 
                        module, section, unit, topic, volume, etc.
                        Remarks: In this DTD, the word "section" is
                        defined for subunits of a <book-part> that are
                        just heads and text, they have no back matter
                        such as appendices and references. By this
                        DTD's definition, if a division of the
                        hierarchical text (in other words, not
                        something out of line like a sidebar) has 
                        formal back matter, then it is a <book-part>.
                        Remarks: The "book-part-type" attribute can
                        be used to name the published name of the
                        component, for text generation or other
                        purposes, for example:
                            <book-part part-type="chapter">
                        Book parts with the title "Part" typically
                        contain other <book-part>s. Book parts with
                        the title "Chapter" typically contain just
                        sections. The deciding factor is how much
                        metadata you need (chapter have only titles,
                        and book parts have a lot of metadata) and
                        whether or not there is formal back matter.
                        Book parts may have back matter; sections
                        may not.                                   -->

                        practice is to use values as defined in
                        RFC 1766, typically 2-letter language
                        codes such as "FR" (French), "EN" (English),
                        and "DE" (German).  These values are NOT
                        case sensitive, so "EN" = "en". The values
                        may include hyphenated differentiators such 
                        as "EN-AU" (Australian English) and "EN-US"
