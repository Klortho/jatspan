Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)

     =============================================================
     Version 2.3                       (DAL/BTU) v2.3 (2007-02-02)
     
     Enhancement Release (2.3) following the Working Group meetings 
     of Oct-Nov/2006-Jan/2007. No backward-incompatible changes.
     Archiving loosened even more. New structures for all the DTDs. 
     
  7. NLM CITATION - Added <nlm-citation> as an alternative to
     unstructured <citation>s by adding <nlm-citation>
     to -%citation.class;. This changed the models for:
      - <ref>, which uses %citation.class; inside %ref-model;
      - <p> through -%p-elements;
      - to inside cell mix (for <td>, <th>, and <entry>)
      - added call to <nlm-citation> module to this module
          
  6. DTD VERSION ATTRIBUTE - Fixed attribute value changed from "2.2" 
     to "2.3" to reflect latest version of DTD
     
  5. Updated public identifier to "v2.3 20070202//EN"          

     =============================================================
     Version 2.2                       (DAL/BTU) v2.2 (2006-04-30)
     
     Backwards-compatible changes to meet operational needs.
     Typical changes include adding attribute values and making 
     required elements optional.
          
  4. DTD VERSION ATTRIBUTE - Fixed attribute value changed from "2.1" 
     to "2.2" to reflect latest version of DTD

  3. ARTICLE TYPES ATTRIBUTE - Added new values to "article-types":
      - dissertation
      - rapid-communication
  
  2. Updated public identifier to "v2.3 20070202//EN"          

     =============================================================
     Version 2.1                       (DAL/BTU) v2.1 (2005-06-30)
     
     Initial DTD creation coincides with Suite 2.1 release
     
  1. Initial creation of this DTD and all its modules with version
     numbers "v2.3 20070202" since this is the version of the DTD
     Suite on which these modules are based. The "dtd-version" fixed 
     attribute was also set to DTD (version "2.1").                -->

<!-- MODULAR DTD LIBRARY
                        A set of journal archiving and interchange 
                        DTD modules was written as the basis for 
                        article creation, publishing, interchange, 
                        and repository DTDs, with the intention that 
                        DTDs for specific purposes, such as this 
                        Authoring  DTD, would be developed based on 
                        them.
                        
                        This Authoring DTD has been optimized for 
                        the creation of new journal articles by
                        individual authors. This means that it lacks
                        all the journal-related material (such as
                        the journal metadata) that are not the
                        responsibility of the author but of the
                        publisher. This DTD is also smaller (fewer 
                        elements and fewer choices in many contexts) 
                        than either the Publishing or Archiving DTDs.
                        It was not the intention to limit the 
                        expressive power licensed by the DTD, but 
                        rather to limit the many paths where there
                        are several ways to tag the same material,
                        where an archiving or publishing DTD needs to
                        be able to accept all styles.              -->

                           This DTD then selects from those
                        modules by referencing the external

                        the entire attribute definition is defined
                        in a Parameter Entity, so the next version

                        practice is to use values as defined in
                        RFC 1766, typically 2-letter language
                        codes such as "FR" (French), "EN" (English),
                        and "DE" (German).  These values are NOT
                        case sensitive, so "EN" = "en". The values
                        may include hyphenated differentiations such 
                        as "EN-AU" (Australian English) and "EN-US"

                        work properly with namespaces unless they
                        are declared on the top level element.
