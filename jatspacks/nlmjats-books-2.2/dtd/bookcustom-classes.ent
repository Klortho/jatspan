<!-- ============================================================= -->
<!--

Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)

     =============================================================
     Version 2.2                       (DAL/BTU) v2.2 (2006-10-13)
     
     Backwards-compatible changes to meet operational needs.
     Typical changes include adding attribute values and making 
     required elements optional.
          
  5. SIGNATURE BLOCK- Added <sig-block>to the end of section <sec>
     by redefining -%sec-back.class;
  
  4. Updated public identifier to "v2.2 20061013//EN"          

     =============================================================
     Version 2.1                       (DAL/BTU) v2.1 (2005-06-30)
          
     Changed to MathML 2.0 and MathML 2.0 Character Sets
     Added new material requested by the online list     

          
  3. PREFORMAT - Book needed to be able to use <named-content>
     inside <preformat>, which Historical could already do, because
     Historical mixes <named-content> into the emphasis.class.
     So the same was done with book and the emphasis override was 
     created in this module to include <named-content>. Now both Book 
     and Historical can treat <named-content> as one of the emphasis 
     elements, and use it almost anywhere. Historical uses it for 
     yellow highlighting, underlining, etc. (Note that Historical
     cannot use the SAME override, because Historical also adds
     <annotation> to the emphasis class.)
     
     Since <named-content> had to be removed from the
     phrase.class to avoid clashes (as the emhasis.class is more
     inclusive), phrase.class was also redefined to remove
     <name-content>.
               
  2. Updated public identifier to "v2.1 20050630" 

     =============================================================
     Version 2.0                    (DAL/BTU/TRG) v2.0 (2005-01-25)
     
  1. Comments for this module were cleaned up as part of the delivery 
     of the NCBI Historical DTD. Since only comments were changed,
     this was not even considered to be a dot release and the
     formal public identifier remained unchanged.                  -->

<!--                    Elements concerning with marking the location
                        of typographical emphasis (highlighting)

                        elements for <fractur>, <openface> (black
                        board), <script>, etc. because this DTD
                        recommends the use of the STIX extensions
                        to accomplish this, as soon as they are 
                        available.
                           Added <page-start>, this milestone element
                        marks the start of a physical page in the 
                        printed edition of a historical work. It
                        is a type of typographic effect, as are the
                        emphasis elements and should be allowed
                        anywhere text is allowed, as they are, thus
                        being excluded from very few elements: all the
                        identifiers, some elements only used inside
                        inside references, and metadata elements.  
                            Added <named-content> (and removed it
                        from %phrase.class;) because it will be
                        used to mark historical emphasis, such as
                        pencil underlining, ink circled words, or 
                        highlighting using a yellow highlighter.
                          Added <annotation>, which is only slightly
                        over-loading this element. An inline
                        <annotation> element is used for inline 
                        commentary, which may not typographical
                        emphasis, but which may be rhetorical 
                        emphasis and, in any case, needs to be
                        used anywhere real emphasis is allowed.    -->
