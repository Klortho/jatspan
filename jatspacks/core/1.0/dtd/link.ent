                        practice is to use values as defined in
                        RFC 1766, typically 2-letter language
                        codes such as "FR" (French), "EN" (English),
                        and "DE" (German). These values are NOT
                        case sensitive, so "EN" = "en". The values
                        may include hyphenated differentiators such 
                        as "EN-AU" (Australian English) and "EN-US"
