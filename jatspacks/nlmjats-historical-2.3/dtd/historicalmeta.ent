Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)

     =============================================================
     Version 2.3                       (DAL/BTU) v2.3 (2007-02-02)
     
     Enhancement Release (2.3) following the Working Group meetings 
     of Oct-Nov/2006-Jan/2007. No backward-incompatible changes.
     Archiving loosened even more. New structures for all the DTDs. 
     
  4. NEW PARAMETER ENTITIES
     a. Added parameter entity for the content model of:
        - printer
     
  3. Updated public identifier to "v2.3 20070202//EN"          

     =============================================================
     Version 2.1                       (DAL/BTU) v2.1 (2005-06-30)
          
     Changed to MathML 2.0 and MathML 2.0 Character Sets
     Added new material requested by NLM/NCBI   
          
  2. PERMISSIONS - Added a new <permissions> wrapper element to
     consolidate copyright and licensing information. For backwards
     compatibility, the new element will be added alongside the
     existing copyright elements. Best practice will be to use the
     new container, but <copyright-statement>, <copyright-year>,
     and <license> will be accepted in their old positions inside
     <digital-edition-meta>
      - Added <permissions> to <digital-edition-meta> model
      - Added <copyright-holder> to <permissions>
               
  1. Updated public identifier to "v2.3 20070202"

<!--                    Container element to hold the metadata that
                        pertains to the electronic transcription
                        (digital edition) not to the work itself.
                        Many of the elements in the digital edition
                        metadata are identical to elements in the 
                        book metadata, but their content will refer
                        to the electronic XML copy of the book,
                        not to the work as a whole or to the specific
                        printed volume.
                            For example, the <contributor> element in
                        the book metadata will name the book's author,
                        editor, illustrator, or other person in a 
                        primary creative role. The contributor in the
                        digital edition metadata began his or her
                        effort with a particular print volume
                        and has played a role in the transcription,
                        annotation, emendment, translation, etc. of
                        that printed book for the electronic archives.
                          Remarks: This element should only be used to

                        in the print and electronic editions, for
                        example the publication date, which might be
                        1653 for the printed work and 2005 for the
                        electronic and the name of the editor of the
