                        of typographical emphasis (highlighting)
                        DTD Design Note: There are no emphasis
                        elements for <fractur>, <openface> (black
                        board), <script>, etc. because this DTD
                        recommends the use of the STIX extensions
                        to accomplish this, as soon as they are 
                        available.
                           Added <page-start>, this milestone element
                        marks the start of a physical page in the 
                        printed edition of a historical work. It
                        is a type of typographic effect, as are the
                        emphasis elements and should be allowed
                        anywhere text is allowed, as they are, thus
                        being excluded from very few elements: all the
                        identifiers, some elements only used inside
                        inside references, and metadata elements.  
                            Added <named-content> (and removed it
                        from %phrase.class;) because it will be
                        used to mark historical emphasis, such as
                        pencil underlining, ink circled words, or 
                        highlighting using a yellow highlighter.
                          Added <annotation>, which is only slightly
                        over-loading this element. An inline
                        <annotation> element is used for inline 
                        commentary, which may not typographical
                        emphasis, but which may be rhetorical 
                        emphasis and, in any case, needs to be
                        used anywhere real emphasis is allowed.    -->
