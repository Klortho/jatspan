Release Notes for JATSPAN at Sourceforge.
These notes are in reverse chronological order (newest releases at the top).

=======================================================================
jatspan-0.7

Changes:
- Changed the name from "nlm-jats" to "jatspan".
- Changed the directory structure again.  This was required to get JATSPacks compatible with EXPath-packaging.  It is a requirement that the directory structure in Subversion and in the released Zip file to be the same as the final on-disk repository layout.  Each JATSPack package, according to this spec, must also have a "content" directory.
- Moved expath-pkg.xml package descriptor files into the root directories.

=======================================================================
nlm-jats-0.6-r123
3/19/2011

This is the first release that has a release tag in the Subversion repository,
see http://jatspan.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/jatspan/releases/0.6/.

Changes:
- Changed the root directory of the distribution file to "nlm-jats", instead of
  using the name of the release.  I think system identifiers in document type
  declarations could use relative pathnames that start with nlm-jats.  There is
  opposition to the idea of using absolute URLs, and I think this would be a
  good compromise.
- Added this ReleaseNotes.txt file.

=======================================================================
nlm-jats-0.5-r110

This was the first alpha release.
