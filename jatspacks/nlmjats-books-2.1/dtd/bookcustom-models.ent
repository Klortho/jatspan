<!--

Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)

     =============================================================
     Version 2.1                       (DAL/BTU) v2.1 (2005-06-30)
          
     Changed to MathML 2.0 and MathML 2.0 Character Sets
     Added new material requested by the online list     

  5. DATE-TYPEs - Deleted the parameter entity that named these,
     since the "date-type" attribute has been set to CDATA. The
     suggested values are retained as part of the documentation.
          
  4. REFERENCE-TYPES - Book needed the same new reference types
     which Historical already had, so moved the ref-type
     over-ride to this module from the Historical override
     module. Book will uses these. The Historical DTD first 
     calls bookcustom-models then historical-models, so it will
     use them as well.
          
  3. TRANS-SUBTITLE - Added optional <trans-subtitle> element to
     to <book-meta> model through -%book-title-group-model;
     also added to %title-group; for book parts.
                
  2. Updated public identifier to "v2.1 20050630" 

     =============================================================
     Version 2.0                    (DAL/BTU/TRG) v2.0 (2005-01-25)
     
  1. Comments for this module were cleaned up as part of the delivery 
     of the NCBI Historical DTD. Since only comments were changed,
     this was not even considered to be a dot release and the
     formal public identifier remained unchanged.                  -->
