         <h1 class="header">Introduction to Attributes</h1>
         <p class="para">This section describes each attribute used in the Journal Archiving Tag Set. Although the attributes are declared in many
            different modules, they are described here in alphabetical order of their tag names
             (i.e., attribute type names). The tag name is the shorter machine-readable name used in
              tagged documents, DTD fragments and schemas, and by software; for example, the
              tag name &#8220;<a href="n-99i0.html"><span class="attrtag">corresp</span></a>&#8221; is used for the attribute named
               &#8220;<a href="n-99i0.html"><span class="attrname">Corresponding Author</span></a>&#8221;.
         </p>
         <p class="para">Each attribute is described by a separate HTML page, where the heading for the page displays the attribute&#8217;s tag name followed
            by its longer descriptive name. The rest of the attribute description page discusses aspects of the attribute, its usage,
            and the elements to which it can be attached. These sections within the page always appear in the following order although
            any given attribute description may not contain all the sections:

                     <p class="para"><em>Elements</em> &#8212; The elements that may take the attribute are named following the phrase &#8220;In elements:&#8221;. For each element, both the tag
                        name (the shorter element type name) and
                         the longer descriptive name are given.

                         in more than one way, or with several slightly different meanings, there will be
                         more than one &#8220;In elements:&#8221; section. Each &#8220;In elements:&#8221; section is followed by a value
                         table that describes the attribute&#8217;s values when it is used with the specific elements just listed. For example, the attribute
                        may have exactly the same meaning whenever
                         it is used, but sometimes it is required while other times it is optional, so there
                         will be two &#8220;In elements:&#8221; sections, one naming all the elements for which the attribute is required, and one naming all
                        the elements for which the attribute is optional.
                     </p>
                     <p class="para"><em>Values</em> &#8212; Following each &#8220;In elements:&#8221; section is an Attribute Value Table that lists the possible values of the attribute and explains
                        selected values. When the attribute originates in the Archiving Tag Set or the base Suite, the Values table also explains
                        the meaning of each value. Attributes defined in PUBLIC tag sets that have been incorporated into the Archiving Tag Set or
                        base Suite (such as the MathML Tag Set) do not have their values explained, since those values are not established in this
                        Tag Set and may change without notice.
                     </p>
                     <p class="para">The Attribute Value Table typically contains two columns although a third column titled &#8220;Behavior&#8221; may be present. Each row
                        in the table describes one value, where:
                     </p>
                     <ul class="bullist">
                        <li>The entry in the column titled &#8220;Value&#8221; names or describes the value,</li>
                        <li>The entry in the column titled &#8220;Meaning&#8221; explains the meaning of the attribute
                            value or describes potential content for the value, and
                        </li>
                        <li>Where present, the entry in the column titled &#8220;Behavior&#8221; describes what an XML application might do with the attribute value.</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p class="para">The last row of the table begins with the word &#8220;Restriction:&#8221;. This row indicates whether the attribute <em>must</em> be supplied when the relevant element is
                         used or is optional and <em>may</em> be supplied. A default value, if any exists, is also provided.

                     <p class="para"><em>Suggested Values</em> &#8212; For those attributes whose value is defined as text (letters, numbers, or special characters), the Tag Set does not enforce
                        any particular value(s), but a list of suggested values may be provided.
