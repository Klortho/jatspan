         <p class="para">This section describes each element in the Journal Archiving DTD. Although the elements are declared in many different modules,
            they are described here in alphabetical order of their tag names
             (i.e., element type names). The tag name is the shorter machine-readable name used in
             tagged documents, DTD fragments and schemas, and by software; for example, the
             tag name <a href="n-7st0.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;p&gt;</span></a> is used for the element named
             <a href="n-7st0.html"><span class="elementname">Paragraph</span></a>.
         </p>
         <p class="para">Each element is described by a separate HTML page, where the heading for the page displays the element&#8217;s tag name followed
            by its longer descriptive name. The rest of the element description page discusses aspects of the element and its usage. These
            sections within the page always appear in the following order although any given element description may not contain all the
            sections:
