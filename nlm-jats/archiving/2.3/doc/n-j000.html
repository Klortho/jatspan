         <p class="para">The Journal Archiving and Interchange Tag Set (hereafter Journal Archiving Tag Set) defines elements and attributes that describe
            the content of journal articles (including some non-article material
             found in journals, such as letters, editorials, and book and product reviews). The Tag Set is intended for use by archives
            as a repository tag set, as well as for transferring journal articles among publishers and archives. The Tag Set is very loose,
            flexible, and permissive in an attempt to capture nearly anything a publisher might have tagged. The philosophy for the Archiving
            Tag Set was to accept as many varied forms of many structures as possible unchanged.
         </p>
         <p class="para">The Journal Archiving Document Type Definition (DTD) is the foundational constraint language for the tag set. The DTD comprises
            a few Archiving-DTD-specific modules and uses (by reference) the base modules of the Journal Archiving and Interchange Suite.
            The modules of that Suite were developed as part of an effort to create XML applications through which materials on health-related
            disciplines could be shared and reused electronically. The Suite can be (and has been) used to construct many tag sets in
            addition to this one. Although the full Suite was developed to support electronic production, the structures should be adequate
            to support some print production as well.
         </p>
         <p class="para">This Tag Library describes the Archiving Tag Set and the Journal Archiving and Interchange Suite, by providing:
            <ul class="bullist">
               <li>An introduction to the design principles for the whole modular

                   the elements and attributes defined in the full Suite.);

            <p class="para">
               Version 2.3 was an enhancement release that made changes requested by the Working Group based on operational concerns. All
               changes to content models and attribute lists have been made backward compatible. As an example, a new XHTML &#8220;style&#8221; attribute
               was added to all the elements inside <a href="n-5e60.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;table&gt;</span></a>and the  &#8220;content-type&#8221; attribute was distributed widely to add or preserve semantic information. The Archiving 2.3 Change

            <hr class="hrule">
            <div class="section"><a name="purpose"></a><h2 class="header">Purpose: Preservation of Intellectual Content</h2>
               <p class="para">The intent of this Tag Set Suite is to &#8220;preserve the
                   intellectual content of journals independent of the form in which that content
                   was originally delivered&#8221;. The tags defined here will be used to describe
                   journal articles that originate with many publishers and societies but whose
                   content will be stored in repositories such as the NLM PubMed Central repository. Therefore,
                   the Suite has been optimized for conversion from a variety of journal source
                   tag sets, with the intent of providing a single format in which publishers can
                   deliver their content to a wide range of archives. There are so many journal
                   tag sets currently in use by publishers, repositories, content-aggregators,
                   scientific societies, and compositors that this Suite cannot possibly
                   incorporate all the variation to be found in such diverse models. But a wide
                   variety of structures can be accommodated, since the content models for the
                   elements have been made very flexible, including a wide range of elements with
                   nearly all content structures optional.
               </p>
               <p class="para">The conversion focus also means that this is a larger, more
                   inclusive tag set than might have been necessary if the intent had been, for
                   example, to create only a Journal Authoring Tag Set. Many elements have been
                   created explicitly so that information tagged by publishers would not be
                   discarded when they converted material from another tag set into the Archival Tag Set created from this Suite. Because of
                  the broad
                   scope of the several proposed electronic archives, this Suite contains elements
                   and attributes that may only occur in a very few journals. Attribute values
                   that a particular tag set would probably restrict to a list of explicit options were declared as
                   data character values, so that all options could be accepted. Care has been
                   taken to provide several mechanisms (frequently, information classing
                   &#8220;type&#8221; attributes) to preserve the intellectual content of a document structure when
                   that structure is converted from another DTD or schema to this tag set, even if
                   there is no exact element equivalent of the structure.
               </p>
               <p class="para">The exact replication of the look and feel of any particular
                   journal has not been a consideration. Therefore, many purely formatting
                   mechanisms have not been included in the tag set.

            <div class="section"><a name="dtdscope"></a><h2 class="header">Scope: Journal Articles Plus</h2>
               <p class="para">Although the  Suite aims at much broader application, this Journal Archiving Tag Set models journal articles, where a journal
                  article is defined as the typical research article found in an STM journal. By design, the definition of an article includes
                  some article-like material
                   also found in journals, for example, letters, editorials, short new pieces, obituaries, meeting reports, and book and product
                  reviews.
               </p>
               <p class="para">By design, this is a model for journal articles, not for complete journals. Thus, there is no overarching model for a collection
                  of articles. In addition, the following journal material has not been described by this tag set:
                  <ul class="bullist">
                     <li>Company or product display advertising;</li>

                     <li>Calendars, meeting schedules, and conference announcements (except as
                         these can be handled as ordinary articles or sections within articles); and
                     </li>
                     <li>Material specific to an individual journal, such as Author Guidelines, Policy and Scope statements, Editorial or advisory
                        boards, detailed indicia, etc.

            <div class="section"><a name="intronlm"></a><h2 class="header">Introduction to the Journal Archiving Tag Set</h2>
               <p class="para">The Journal Archiving Tag Set defines a document that is a top-level component of a journal such as an article, a book or
                  product review, or a letter to the editor. Each
                   such document is composed of one or more parts; if there is more than one part, they must appear in the
                   following order:
                   
                  <ul class="bullist">
                     <li>Front matter (required). The article front matter contains
                         the metadata for the article (also called article header information), for example,  the article title, the journal in which
                        it appears, the date and issue of publication for that issue of that journal, a copyright statement, etc. This is not textual
                        front matter as in books, this is bibliographic information about the article and the journal in which it was published.
                     </li>
                     <li>Body of the article (optional). The body of the article is
                         the main textual and graphic content of the article. This usually consists of
                         paragraphs and sections, which may themselves contain figures, tables, sidebars
                         (boxed text), etc. The body of the article is optional to accommodate those repositories that just keep article header information
                        and do not tag the textual content.
                     </li>
                     <li>Back matter for the article (optional). If present,
                         the article back matter contains information that is ancillary to the main text, such as a glossary,
                         appendix, or list of cited references.
                     </li>
                     <li>Floating Material (optional). A publisher may choose to place all the floating objects in an article and its back matter (such
                        as tables, figures, boxed text sidebars, etc.) into a separate container element outside the narrative flow for convenience
                        of processing.
                     </li>
                     <li>Following the front, body, back,  and (optional) floating material, there may be either one or more responses to the article
                        or one or more
                         subordinate articles:
                         
                        <ul class="bullist">
                           <li>Response (rarely used). A response is a commentary on
                               the article itself, for example, an opinion from an editor on the importance of
                               the article or a reply from the original author to a letter concerning his
                               article.
                           </li>
                           <li>Sub-article. A sub-article is a small
                               article that is completely contained inside another article, for example, a series of small news stories on the same topic
                               where there is a single introduction, followed by small news pieces.
                           </li>

               <p class="para">The Archiving and Interchange Suite has been written as a set of XML DTD &#8220;modules&#8221;, each of which is a separate physical file.
                  No module
                   is an entire DTD by itself, but these modules can be combined into a number of
                   different DTDs, for example, both an Archival and Interchange DTD and an
                   Archival Authoring DTD. Modules are primarily intended for maintenance; all
                   the elements of the same &#8220;type&#8221; (class) are stored together.
                   
               </p>
               <p class="para">The Journal Article  Archival and Interchange DTD for the National
                   Library of Medicine has been built from these modules; both this DTD and
                   the individual modules will be described in this Tag Library.
               </p>
               <p class="para">The major disadvantage of a modular system is the longer learning
                   curve, since it may not be immediately obvious <em>where</em>
                   within the system to find a particular element or attribute cluster. To help
                   with this, the description of each element in the Element Section of this
                   documentation names the module in which that element is defined.
               </p>
               <p class="para">There are many advantages to such a modular approach. The smaller
                   units are written once, maintained in one place, and used in many different
                   DTDs. This makes it much easier to keep lower level structures consistent
                   across document types, while allowing for any real differences that analysis
                   identifies. A DTD for a new function (such as an authoring DTD) or a new
                   publication type can be built quickly, since most of the necessary components
                   will already be defined in the Suite. Editorial and production personnel
                   can bring the experience gained on one tagging project directly to the next
                   with very little loss or retraining. Customized software (including authoring,
                   typesetting, and electronic display tools) can be written once, shared among
                   projects, and modified only for real distinctions.

                     <li>Journal Publishing Tag Set (Publishing) &#8212; A public Tag Set for use as a repository tag set by archives which desire consistent
                        processing and searching capability. The Publishing Tag Set is a more prescriptive and restrictive subset of the Journal Archiving
                        and Interchange Suite than the Journal Archiving Tag Set (above). This Tag Set may also be used to transfer content between
                        archives or as a base tag set for Publishers.
                     </li>
                     <li>Article Authoring Tag Set (Authoring) &#8212; A public Tag Set intended for writing and editing <em>new</em> journal articles. The Authoring Tag Set has been  designed to enable &#8220;good&#8221; journal coding and to provide assistance to authors
                        and editors through more restricted models than the interchange and repository tag sets allow.
                     </li>
                     <li>NCBI Book, Book Collection, and Historical Book Tag Sets &#8212; The NCBI Book Tag Set defines elements and attributes that describe
                        the content of books such as pamphlets and monographs. The NCBI Book Collection Tag Set describes a document that contains
                        metadata for a grouping or &#8220;collection&#8221; of books, potentially followed by textual information about the books in the collection,
                        and a listing of the books; the content of the books is not included. The NCBI Historical Book Tag Set  is a layer on top
                        of the NCBI Book Tag Set  specifically
                           designed to describe historical materials by adding structures relevant to the digitization of historical works, for example
                        metadata concerning the digital edition. The three  NCBI book tag sets were written to specific NCBI book requirements and
                        are therefore not generic tag sets in the same way that all the journal article tag sets are generic.

               <p class="para">Because access for a wide range of output devices, as well as for
                         the visually impaired, is becoming more and more important in the STM journal
                         community, the modules in this Suite were designed to follow, as much as
                         possible, the W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-WCAG20-20020822/"><span class="citetitle">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
                               2.0</span></a> working draft (22 August 2002), which was the latest accessibility specification
                         available when the Suite was initially constructed. This Specification specifies
                         accessibility guidelines on many levels from design through application. The
                         guidelines which pertain to the modeling of materials were followed to at least
                         Level-2 compliance. For example, a <a href="n-gj40.html"><span class="elementname">Long Description</span></a> <a href="n-gj40.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;long-desc&gt;</span></a> element was defined as part of many
                         other elements, such as <a href="n-h4w0.html"><span class="elementname">Figure</span></a> <a href="n-h4w0.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;fig&gt;</span></a>, so it can be added
                         not only to all figures and other graphical objects, but to any section of the
                         text (for example, to a <a href="n-pn30.html"><span class="elementname">Boxed Text</span></a> <a href="n-pn30.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;boxed-text&gt;</span></a>) to
                         provide an accessible description of the object. The <a href="n-dcq0.html"><span class="attrtag">xml:lang</span></a> attribute was added to all
                         section-level elements and many paragraph-level elements to permit explicit
                         indication of the language of the content, as required by these guidelines. The <a href="n-5900.html"><span class="elementname">Abbreviation or Acronym</span></a> <a href="n-5900.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;abbrev&gt;</span></a> element (also to be used for acronyms) was added to meet Checkpoint 4.3.

                         that can be combined into a number of different DTDs. The modules are separate
                         physical files that, taken together, define all element structures (such as
                         tables, math, chemistry, paragraphs, sections, figures, footnotes, and
                         reference elements), as well as attributes and entities in the Suite.
               </p>
               <p class="para">Modules in the Suite are primarily intended to group elements for maintenance.
                         There are different kinds of modules. A module may either:
                         
                  <ul class="bullist">
                     <li>Be a building block for a base DTD (such as the <a href="n-kdz0.html"><span class="pename">Module to Name the Modules</span></a> module)
                     </li>
                     <li>Define the elements inside a particular structure. For
                                   example, the <a href="n-77k2.html"><span class="pename">Bibliography References (Citation) Elements Module</span></a> module names all the potential components of
                                   bibliographic reference lists.
                     </li>
                     <li>Name the members of a &#8220;class&#8221; of elements,
                                   where class is a named grouping of elements that share a similar usage or
                                   potential location. For example, the <a href="n-v5k2.html"><span class="pename">Phrase-Level Content Elements Module</span></a> module defines small floating
                                   elements that may occur within text, such as inside a paragraph or a title, or
                                   that describe textual content, for example, a disease name, drug name, or the
                                   name of a discipline.
                     </li>
                     <li>Be a module of &#8220;editorial convenience&#8221;. For
                                   example, the <a href="n-76b0.html"><span class="pename">Common (Shared) Element Declarations Module</span></a> module holds elements and attributes used in the

               <p class="para">Parameter Entities are the
                         major mechanism for customizing a DTD or creating a new DTD from the modules in
                         the Suite. Individual DTDs will be constructed by 1) establishing element and
                         attribute combinations and content models using Parameter Entities in one of the DTD-specific customizing modules and
                  2) choosing appropriate modules from the Suite that declare the elements needed.
                         For example, if the base DTD contained 6 kinds of lists
                         and 2 table models, a more specific DTD, such as an authoring DTD, might use a
                         Customize Classes Module to redefine the List Class to name only 3 lists and
                         redefine the Display Class to allow only one table model.
               </p>
               <p class="para">The standard modules to create a customized DTD are: the DTD itself, a module to name its components, and as many over-ride

                                   unique to the new document type.)

               <p class="para">Many of the elements in the Journal Archiving DTD have been
                         grouped into loose element classes. There is no hard and fast rule for what constitutes a class; each one is a design
                  decision, a matter of judgment. These classes are designed to ease customization to meet the particular needs of new DTDs.
                  Base classes for the Suite are defined in a separate <a href="n-gt90.html"><span class="pename">Default Element Classes Module</span></a> (<a href="n-gt90.html"><span class="petag">%default-classes.ent;</span></a>).

               <p class="para">Content models are built using sequences of elements, and OR groups that are classes (typically) or mixes. As an example,
                  the content model for a <a href="n-7st0.html"><span class="elementname">Paragraph</span></a>  element is declared to be an OR group (that is, a choice) of
                         <em>text, numbers, or special characters</em> and any of the elements named in the <a href="n-49z0.html"><span class="pename">Paragraph Elements</span></a> mix. The mix <a href="n-49z0.html"><span class="petag">%p-elements;</span></a> is
                         declared to be a large OR group of many other element-defining classes: the <a href="n-5wb0.html"><span class="pename">Block Display Class Elements</span></a>, the <a href="n-g7z0.html"><span class="pename">Mathematical Expressions Class Elements</span></a>, the <a href="n-8sz0.html"><span class="pename">List Class Elements</span></a>, the <a href="n-nfb0.html"><span class="pename">Citation Class Elements</span></a>, et al.
               </p>
               <p class="para">These element classes can be viewed as building blocks that will
                         be used to build larger Parameter Entities for element mixes. (Note: A mix describes a
                         usage circumstance for a group of elements, such as all the paragraph-level
                         elements, all the elements allowed inside a table cell, all the elements inside
                         a paragraph, or all the inline elements). For example, to add another block display item to the <a href="n-5wb0.html"><span class="pename">Block Display Class Elements</span></a>, you
                         would edit the <a href="n-5wb0.html"><span class="petag">%block-display.class;</span></a> Parameter Entity in the
                         DTD-specific Archive Class Over-ride Module to override the default Parameter Entity in the Suite&#8217;s <a href="n-gt90.html"><span class="pename">Default Element Classes Module</span></a> module and create a new module containing the Element Declaration of the new block display item.

                     in the DTD itself. The new DTD
                     will be fairly short and include only definitions of the topmost elements, at least the document element and maybe its children.

                  <p class="para">To show the process, here is a series of instructions for making a new DTD, illustrated by showing how the Journal Archiving
                     DTD was created from the modules of the whole Suite.
                     <ol class="olist">
                        <li><strong>Modules</strong> &#8212; Write a new DTD-specific Module of Modules which defines all new customization modules the DTD needs. (As an example, 
                           the Archiving DTD created the module <tt>%archivecustom-modules.ent;</tt>, which contains the definitions of the class-over-ride module <tt>%archivecustom-classes.ent;</tt>, the mix-over-ride module <tt>%archivecustom-mixes.ent;</tt>, and the models-over-ride module <tt>%archivecustom-models.ent;</tt>.)
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Class Over-rides</strong> &#8212; Write a DTD-specific class-over-ride module, defining any over-rides
                           to the Suite classes, which are defined in the default classes module, <tt>%default-classes.ent;</tt>.  (As an example,  the Archiving DTD created the module <tt>%archivecustom-classes.ent;</tt>, in which a new model for <tt>%contrib-info.class;</tt> was declared and an entirely new class <tt>%x.class;</tt> was added.)
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Mix Over-rides</strong> &#8212; Write a DTD-specific mix-over-ride module defining any over-rides
                           to the Suite mixes, which are defined in the default mixes module, <tt>%default-mixes.ent;</tt>.  (As an example,  the Archiving DTD created the module <tt>%archivecustom-mixes.ent;</tt>, in which  a new mix <tt>%all-phrase;</tt> was declared and then used in many existing mixes such as <tt>%simple-phrase;</tt>.)
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Model Over-rides</strong> &#8212; Create a DTD-specific content-model-over-ride module defining any over-rides
                           to the  content models and
                           attribute lists for the Suite. (As an example, the Archiving DTD created the module <tt>%archivecustom-models.ent;</tt>, in which element collections (suffixed &#8220;<tt>-elements</tt>&#8221;) that will be mixed with <tt>#PCDATA</tt> were redefined,   full content models over-rides (suffixed &#8220;<tt>-model</tt>&#8221;) were redefined, and some new attributes and attribute lists were added.) 
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>New Elements</strong> &#8212; Write any new element modules needed. These will define any new block-level or phrase-level elements. (As an example, the
                           Archiving Tag Set did not need any new elements not in the Suite, but the new NLM Book Tag Set added modules for book metadata
                           and book component parts.)
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>DTD Module</strong> &#8212; With those modules in place, construct a new DTD module. Within that module:

                              <li>Use an External Parameter Entity reference to call in the

                              <li>Use an External Parameter Entity reference to call any new DTD-specific module defining new block-level or phrase-level elements.
                                 (For the Archiving DTD, the module <a href="n-hhz0.html"><span class="petag">%nlmcitation.ent;</span></a> in which a more prescriptive citation element, <a href="n-2is0.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;nlm-citation&gt;</span></a>, is declared)

                     <p class="para">PARAMETER ENTITY: SAME FUNCTION, SAME NAME &#8212; The Suite modules and initial DTDs have used a series of Parameter Entity naming
                        conventions consistently. While parsing software cannot enforce these Parameter Entity naming or usage conventions, these
                        conventions can make it much easier for a person to know how the content models work and what must be modified to make a DTD
                        change.

                           and classes for all OR groups. Only content model sequences are made

                           and named separately to preserve the mixed-content or element-
