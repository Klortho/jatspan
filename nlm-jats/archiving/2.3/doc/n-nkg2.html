&lt;!-- SYSTEM:     Journal Archiving and Interchange DTD of the      --&gt;
&lt;!--             Archiving and Interchange DTD Suite               --&gt;
&lt;!--                                                               --&gt;
&lt;!-- PURPOSE:    DTD to describe a full-text journal article       --&gt;
&lt;!--                                                               --&gt;
&lt;!--             The Journal Archiving and Interchange DTD         --&gt;
&lt;!--             describes journal articles and some non-article   --&gt;
&lt;!--             material such as product and book reviews for     --&gt;
&lt;!--             repository or interchange purposes. It describes  --&gt;
&lt;!--             both the metadata for a journal article and the   --&gt;
&lt;!--             full content of the article.                      --&gt;
&lt;!--             This DTD was constructed using the modules in the --&gt;

&lt;!--                    DTD VERSION/CHANGE HISTORY                 --&gt;
&lt;!-- ============================================================= --&gt;
&lt;!--

     =============================================================

Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)

     =============================================================
     Version 2.3                       (DAL/BTU) v2.3 (2007-02-02)

     Enhancement Release (2.3) following the Working Group meetings
     of Oct-Nov/2006-Jan/2007. No backward-incompatible changes.
     Archiving loosened even more. New structures for all the DTDs.

21. FLOATS WRAPPER - Added new element &lt;floats-wrap&gt; to both of the
     models for article (article-short and article-full) and the model
     for sub-article. This new element, which follows the &lt;back&gt;
     element, is a  just a wrapper to hold the floating objects that
     occur anywhere in the article. Some publishers like to
     collect all the "floating objects" (figures, tables, text boxes,
     graphics, etc.) together at the end of the document rather than
     interspersing them throughout the parts of the article where
     they are referenced.


 20. NLM CITATION - Added &lt;nlm-citation&gt; as an alternative to
     unstructured &lt;citation&gt;s by adding &lt;nlm-citation&gt;
     to -%citation.class;. This changed the models for:
      - &lt;ref&gt;, which uses %citation.class; inside %ref-model;
      - &lt;p&gt; through &amp;p-elements;
      - to inside cell mix
      - added &lt;nlm-citation&gt; module declaration to
          -%archivecustom-modules.ent;
      - invoked -%nlm-citation.ent in this DTD

 19. DTD VERSION ATTRIBUTE - Fixed attribute value changed from "2.2"
     to "2.3" to reflect latest version of DTD

 18. Updated public identifier to "v2.3 20070202//EN"

     =============================================================
     Version 2.2                       (DAL/BTU) v2.2 (2006-04-30)

     Backwards-compatible changes to meet operational needs.
     Typical changes include adding attribute values and making
     required elements optional.

 17. DTD VERSION ATTRIBUTE - Fixed attribute value changed from "2.1"
     to "2.2" to reflect latest version of DTD

 16. RESPONSE TYPE ATTRIBUTE - Only the comment has changed to reflect
     the usage. First, the use of the attribute is no longer
     discouraged. Second, there are a few suggested values.

 15. SUB-ARTICLE/RESPONSE METADATA
     a. Added new element &lt;front-stub&gt; as an alternative to the
     typical &lt;front&gt; metadata inside a  &lt;sub-article&gt;, so that not
     as much metadata is replicated between the article and
     sub-article. For example, a &lt;sub-article&gt; that uses a
     &lt;front-stub&gt; will inherit all of its &lt;journal-meta&gt; from the
     journal meta of the associated article.

     b. Changed the model for %article-short-model; (which is used
        only for &lt;response&gt; to also use &lt;front-stub&gt;

 14. ID ATTRIBUTES- Added &lt;sub-article&gt; and &lt;response&gt; through
     their attribute Parameter Entities

 13. SIGNATURE BLOCK- Added &lt;sig-block&gt; to the end of article &lt;body&gt;

 12. ARTICLE TYPES ATTRIBUTE - Added new values to the list of
     suggested values in the comments:
      - collection
      - dissertation
      - partial-retraction
      - rapid-communication
      - reprint
      - translation

 11. Updated public identifier to "v2.2 20060430//EN"

     =============================================================
     Version 2.1                       (DAL/BTU) v2.1 (2005-06-30)


     Changed to MathML 2.0 and MathML 2.0 Character Sets
     Added new material requested by the online list

 10. Modified Module of Modules to include new MathML 2.0 DTD
     (mathml2.dtd,v 1.12 2003/11/04) and modified entity
     "xmlspecchars.ent" to include the new MathML Character sets
     which match Unicode 4.0.

     Implementor Alert: New directory structure for the character
     sets was also adopted, to match the new MathML directories.

     Implementor Alert: New directory structure for the character
     sets was also adopted, to match the new MathML directories.
     There are now 3 character set directories:
            - iso8879 (from SGML used in MathML)
            - iso9573-13 (from ISO Tech Rpt used in MathML)
            - xmlchars (from SGML not used in MathML)

  9. Updated public identifier to "v2.3 20070202", modified the
     fpis of the updated modules (both publishing custom modules
     and the Suite modules), and changed the "dtd-version" fixed
     attribute to reference latest version of DTD (version "2.1").

     =============================================================
     Version 2.0                       (DAL/BTU) v2.0 (2004-07-30)


     Major requirement changes led to the new release, producing
     DTD version "2.0":
       a) The splitting of the Archival and Interchange Tag Set
          DTDs into three DTDs from two: an authoring DTD, an
          archive regularization and interchange DTD (the
          current Blue Publishing DTD), and a preservationist
          archive DTD (the current Green Archiving and Interchange
          DTD).
       b) AIT Working Group suggestions from the June 04 meeting
          and June/July 2004 followup discussions
       c) Suite remodularization to meet new (and newly articulated)
          modularization requirements
       d) New or renamed classes and mixes to make modifications
          easier and more consistent

  8. COMPLETE MODELS WHEN OVER-RIDING A CONTENT MODEL
     (for all Parameter Entities suffixed "-model")
     ### Customization Alert ###
     Made all the model over-rides consistent. Some included
     the outer parentheses, some did not. They all do now.
     Added parentheses to Parameter Entity and removed them
     from the Element Declarations:
     -  %article-short-model;
     -  %article-full-model;
     -  %front-model;
     -  %body-model;
     -  %back-model;

  7. ATTRIBUTE VALUE LISTS
     a. For the Green (Preservationist Archival) DTD, changed all
        explicit attribute value lists to CDATA. In the future,
        attribute value lists will be a feature of the Blue
        (Publishing) and new Authoring DTDs.
        - Added Parameter Entities to hold "date-type"
        - Changed the following attributes:
             article-type (in %article-atts;)
     b. Removed Parameter Entity definition for
        %article-types: since it was not being used at all!
        The attribute takes CDATA values.

     c. SUBARTICLE ATTRIBUTES - made into a Parameter Entity


  6. PARAMETER ENTITY CLEANUP AND REGULARIZATION

     a. RENAME ELEMENT MIXES NOT TO END IN "-elements"
        ### Customization Alert ###
        Names ending in "-elements" saved for the particular mixes
        that will be added to #PCDATA for a particular element,
        therefore:
        -  %doc-back-matter-elements; ==&gt; %doc-back-matter-mix;

     b. FRONT MATTER MODEL - rewritten to use new class Parameter
        Entity %front-back.class; and to use %list.class; rather
        than just &lt;def-list&gt;. This widens the model of Front Matter
        by adding &lt;list&gt;.

  5. REMODULARIZATION - The entire Archiving and Interchange DTD
     Suite was remodularized. Replaced the previous single Archiving
     customization module (archivecustomize.ent) with the
     following single-function customization modules:
       - archivecustom-modules.ent (DTD-specific module naming)
       - archivecustom-classes.ent (DTD-specific classes over-rides)
       - default.classes (Default classes declarations)
       - archivecustom-mixes.ent (DTD-specific mixes over-rides)
       - default-mixes (Default mixes declarations)
       - archivecustom-models.ent (DTD-specific content model
         over-rides to the base Suite)
            There are two types of such over-rides. One that
            replaces a complete content model (which are named with a
            suffix "-model") and those that are OR groups of
            elements, intended to be mixed with #PCDATA inside
            a particular model (which are named with an "-elements"
            suffix).

  4. VERSION 2.0 - Updated public identifier to "v2.1 20050630" on
     this module and the module-of-modules module and changed the
     "dtd-version" fixed attribute to reference latest version
     of DTD (version "2.0").

     =============================================================
     Version 1.1                           (TRG) v1.1 (2003-11-01)

  3. Updated public identifier to "v1.1 20031101"

  2. Changed Parameter Entity %dtd-version; to reference latest
     version of DTD (version 1.1)

  1. Updated public identifiers for modules.ent and
     archivecustomize.ent to reflect modules' modification.
     Rationale: To call updated modules.
                                                                   --&gt;


&lt;!-- ============================================================= --&gt;
&lt;!--                    DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS                      --&gt;
&lt;!-- ============================================================= --&gt;


&lt;!-- MODULAR DTD LIBRARY
                        A set of journal archiving and interchange
                        DTD modules was written as the basis for
                        publishing, interchange, and repository
                        DTDs, with the intention that DTDs for
                        specific purposes, such as this Journal
                        Archiving and Interchange DTD, would be
                        developed based on them.

                        This archiving DTD has been designed to
                        be descriptive, open, and inclusive to
                        allow journal articles to be translated into
                        this format as conveniently as possible
                        from a wide variety of proprietary journal
                        article DTDs (such as Blackwell, Keton, and
                        Ovid).

                        This Archiving DTD has been developed from
                        the Archiving and Interchange DTD Suite
                        modules, in the approved manner, making
                        changes to the declarations in those modules
                        by over-riding Parameter Entity contents
                        by redefining the entities in the
                            %archivecustomize.ent;
                        module, which is called from this DTD file.
                        No changes to any of the original Archiving
                        and Interchange Suite modules are required
                        in order to use this DTD.                  --&gt;

&lt;!-- THE MANY ROADS NOT TAKEN
                        In the interest of getting a version of this
                        DTD into production as quickly as practical,
                        several structures and functions that might
                        be appropriately included have been delayed
                        until a future version of this DTD. Such
                        components include:
                          - Questions and Answers (These may be
                              modeled with the current DTDs by using
                              paragraphs and lists)
                          - Continuing Medical Education material
                             (which frequently contains questions
                             and answers)
                          - Forms and fill-in-the-blank
                          - Conflict of Interest statements and
                              Financial Disclosure (May be modeled
                              as paragraphs or footnotes)
                          - Electronic and Digital Rights Management
                          - Advertising included in the journal:
                                + Job ads
                                + Classified advertising
                                + Display advertising
                          - Calendars, meeting schedules, and
                              announcements.  (These can be handled
                              as ordinary articles or sections within
                              articles)
                          - About the Journal material such as Author
                              Guidelines, Policy and Scope statements,
                              Editorial or advisory boards, detailed
                              indicia, etc.

&lt;!--                    Declares all the external modules that are
                        part of the modular Journal Archiving and
                        Interchange DTD Suite library. Thus it does
                        NOT declare itself; the DTD-specific
                        module-of-modules; any DTD-specific class,
                        mix, or model over-ride modules; or any new
                        new content modules specific to this DTD.
                        Those are declared in the DTD-specific
                        module of modules.
                           Since this module declares but does not
                        invoke modules, this DTD then invokes any
                        modules it uses by referencing the external
                        Parameter Entities defined in the Module of
                        Modules. To include a set of elements (such
                        as all the lists or the MathML elements) this
                        module defines the external Parameter Entity
                        for the module(s) that contains the MathML
                        declarations and the DTD references that
                        entity.                                    --&gt;

                        a short sub-article such as a news brief that
                        is contained in side a journal article.

                        objects (figures, tables, text boxes,
                        graphics, etc.) together at the end rather

&lt;!--                    Typical journal article model, which may
                        contain extended components, such as
                        sub-articles or responses, but which usually
                        contains neither.
                        The &lt;floats-wrap&gt; container element is just
                        a wrapper to hold the floating objects
                        that occur anywhere in the article. Some
                        publishers like to collect all the floating
                        objects (figures, tables, text boxes,
                        graphics, etc.) together at the end rather
                        than interspersing them throughout the parts
                        of the article where they are referenced.  --&gt;

&lt;!--                    The complete content of a journal article.
                        An article is potentially divided into
                        four (more typically three) parts: 1) the
                        Front Matter (article metadata or header),
                        the body of the article (main content), any
                        ancillary information such as a glossary or
                        appendix, and (the least common) a
                        response, that is a commentary on the
                        article itself.                            --&gt;

&lt;!--         article-type
                        What kind of article is this?
                        Note: When the article is a commentary on
                        another article, for example a correction or
                        addendum, this attribute is metadata for the
                        commentary itself, it does NOT define the
                        kind of article that is being corrected or
                        amended.
                          This is an optional CDATA attribute, but
                        an article type should be identified if
                        possible. Potential values include:
                          abstract   The article itself is an
                                     abstract (of a paper or
                                     presentation), usually that
                                     has been presented or published
                                     separately.

                        Which version of the DTD does this article
                        use? The value is a #FIXED attribute, so
                        the entire attribute definition is defined
                        in a Parameter Entity, so the next version
                        of the DTD can use a different #FIXED value.
             xml:lang   The language in which the value of the
                        element is expressed.  Recommended best
                        practice is to use values as defined in
                        RFC 1766, typically 2-letter language
                        codes such as "FR" (French), "EN" (English),
                        and "DE" (German).  These values are NOT
                        case sensitive, so "EN" = "en". The values
                        may include hyphenated differentiations such
                        as "EN-AU" (Australian English) and "EN-US"
                        (United States English).

                        inherit the value set on &lt;article&gt; unless

                        MathML modules. These xmlns are called
                        here because certain older tools will not
                        work properly with namespaces unless they
                        are declared on the top level element.

                        may not share with the article that
                        encloses it.

                        other articles rarely contain much content of

&lt;!--                    RESPONSE                                   --&gt;
&lt;!--                    Reply, response, or commentary concerning the
                        journal article. In the typical case, the
                        response is included in the same XML package
                        as the original article, and thus attached
                        at the end of the article proper.
                        Authoring Note: Frequently a reply or
                        response is an article in its own right, not
                        included as part of the original article.
                        Such an article could use the
                        &lt;related-article&gt; element in the article
                        metadata to record the metadata for the
                        original article.
                        Conversion Note: This construction can also
                        be used for the pathological case, rarely
                        seen, in which several responses to an
                        article are lumped together into a single
                        container which is not the original article,
                        merely a collection of responses. In one
                        example we examined, the first two responses
                        were to an original article which was else-
                        where and the third response was a response
                        to the first two responses.                --&gt;

                        What kind of response is this?
                        Note: This does NOT define the kind of
                        article on which the response is commenting,
                        it is metadata for the response itself.
                        Suggested values include:
                         addendum    Adds additional information or
                                     clarification to the parent
                                     article
                         discussion  Discussion related to a specific
                                     issue described in the parent
                                     article
                         reply       Reply to the parent article.
                                     This is the most commonly used
                                     value.

                        describe cases in which a series of articles
                        is chained together: typically as an
                        introduction to the article, an article, then
                        several responses to the article.
             id         Unique identifier so the element may be
                        referenced
             xml:lang   The language in which the value of the
                        element is expressed.  Recommended best
                        practice is to use values as defined in
                        RFC 1766, typically 2-letter language
                        codes such as "FR" (French), "EN" (English),
                        and "DE" (German).  These values are NOT
                        case sensitive, so "EN" = "en". The values
                        may include hyphenated differentiations such
                        as "EN-AU" (Australian English) and "EN-US"
                        (United States English).
                        Processing and Conversion Note: All other
                        xml:lang attributes within the article
                        inherit the value set on &lt;article&gt; unless
                        explicitly set themselves with their own
                        "xml:lang" attribute.                      --&gt;
