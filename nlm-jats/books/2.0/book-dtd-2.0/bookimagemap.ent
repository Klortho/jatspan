            map-coords  Map Coordinate - Point coordinates that define
                        the hot spots being mapped. For a rectangle,
                        this is the (x,y) coordinates for the top left

                        circle center and the radius value, for any 
                        other regular polygon, this is the (x,y) 
                        coordinates of each corner. 
                          All coordinates are relative to 0,0, which 
                        is the upper left corner of the graphic.
