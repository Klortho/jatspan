                        pertains to the electronic transcription
                        (digital edition) not to the work itself.
                        Many of the elements in the digital edition
                        metadata are identical to elements in the 
                        book metadata, but their content will refer
                        to the electronic XML copy of the book,
                        not to the work as a whole or to the specific
                        printed volume.
                            For example, the <contributor> element in
                        the book metadata will name the book's author,

                        effort with a particular print volume
