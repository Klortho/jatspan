Version  Reason/Occasion                   (who) vx.x (yyyy-mm-dd)

     =============================================================
     Version 2.1                       (DAL/BTU) v2.1 (2005-06-30)
          
     Changed to MathML 2.0 and MathML 2.0 Character Sets
     Added new material requested by NLM/NCBI   

  4. DATE-TYPEs - Deleted the parameter entity that named these,
     since the "date-type" attribute has been set to CDATA by the
     Book model customization module that is used by Historical. 
     The suggested values are retained as part of the documentation.
          
  3. REFERENCE-TYPES - Book needed the same new reference types
     which Historical already had, so moved the ref-type
     over-ride from this module to the Book override module.
     The Historical DTD first calls bookcustom-models then 
     historical-models, so there is content change in the
     Historical DTD.
          
  2. PERMISSIONS - Added a new <permissions> wrapper element to
     consolidate copyright and licensing information. For backwards
     compatibility, the new element will be added alongside the
     existing copyright elements. Best practice will be to use the
     new container, but <copyright-statement>, <copyright-year>,
     and <license> will be accepted in their old positions inside
     <book-meta>
      - Added <permissions> to <book-meta> model
      - Added <copyright-holder> to <permissions>
               
  1. Updated public identifier to "v2.1 20050630" 
                                                                   -->

<!--                    Attribute list for the <annotation> element,
                        which is defined in %references.ent;
                        For the purposes of this DTD, annotations of 
                        historical material are considered to be of
                        two types: those with content, that is those 
                        add words to the text (for example, a
                        penciled marginal note) and those that merely
                        decorate words already in the text, for 
                        example, a phrase underlined in pencil.
                          Text-bearing annotations, whether inline
                        or block-level, use the <annotation> or the
                        <alt-text> elements. Decorations use the
                        <named-content> element with the attribute
                        "content-type" taking values like "underline"
                        and "yellow highlighter".
                           The <annotation> and <named-content>
                        elements are not defined in this module, since
                        they were already part of the NLM Archiving 
                        and Interchange DTD Suite when this DTD was
                        was written. No changes were needed to the
                        <named-content> element except that it is
                        allowed in a few more places through the
                        modification of the %phrase.class; and
                        %emphasis.class; elements.
                           In the Suite, however, the <annotation>
                        element is only used within citations. In 
                        this DTD, it is a block-level element at the 
                        same level as a paragraph (%para-level;) as 
                        well as an inline-element inside textual 
                        passages (%emphasis.class;). New attributes 
                        were  added to <annotation> to describe some 
                        of these new roles/purposes.               -->
