    <title>About this book</title>
    <sec sec-type="miscinfo">
    <title>The NCBI Handbook</title>
      <p>Bioinformatics consists of a computational approach to biomedical 
      information management and analysis. It is being used increasingly as 
      a component of research within both academic and industrial settings 
      and is becoming integrated into both undergraduate and postgraduate 
      curricula. The new generation of biology graduates is emerging with 
      experience in using bioinformatics resources and, in some cases, 
      programming skills.</p>
      <p>The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) is one 
      of the world's premier Web sites for biomedical and bioinformatics 
      research. Based within the National Library of Medicine at the National 
      Institutes of Health, USA, the NCBI hosts many databases used by 
      biomedical and research professionals. The services include PubMed, 
      the bibliographic database; GenBank, the nucleotide sequence database; 
      and the BLAST algorithm for sequence comparison, among many others. 
      The NCBI Web site is visited by about 250,000 people per day.</p>
      <p>Although each NCBI resource has online help documentation associated 
      with it, there is no cohesive approach to describing the databases and 
      search engines, nor any significant information on how the databases 
      work or how they can be leveraged, for bioinformatics research on a 
      larger scale. The NCBI Handbook is designed to address this information 
      gap.</p>
      <p>All of our users know how to execute a straightforward PubMed or 
      BLAST search. However, feedback from help desk personnel and booth 
      staff at scientific meetings suggests that people often want to know 
      how to use our resources in a more sophisticated manner and are 
      frequently unaware of less well-known databases that might be helpful 
      to them. The intended audience for The NCBI Handbook is, therefore, 
      the growing number of scientists and students who would like a more 
      in-depth guide to NCBI resources&mdash;powerusers and aspiring 
      powerusers.</p>
      <p>The NCBI Handbook is focused on the relatively stable information 
      about each resource; it is not a point-and-click user guide (this 
      type of information can be found in the online help documents, 
      referred to frequently but not repeated, in the Handbook). Each 
      chapter is devoted to one service; after a brief overview on using 
      the resource, there is an account of how the resource works, including 
      topics such as how data are included in a database, database design, 
      query processing, and how the different resources relate to each 
      other. For example, the BLAST chapter briefly describes what to use 
      BLAST for, the various varieties of the BLAST algorithm, and BLAST 
      statistics, before discussing output formats, query processing, and 
      tips for setting up a BLAST database. A certain amount of biological 
      knowledge is assumed.</p>
      <p>The online content will be updated when necessary, although major 
      changes are not expected to occur more than once every few years. 
      (For example, PubMed query processing does not change dramatically 
      year after year.) We hope that The NCBI Handbook will provide a 
      valuable reference for anyone who wants to use our resources more 
      effectively.</p>

              <title>Summary</title>
              <p>The GenBank sequence database is an annotated collection of all publicly available nucleotide sequences and their protein translations. This database is produced at National Center for Biotechnology Information (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1353">NCBI</xref>) as part of an international collaboration with the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) Data Library from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). GenBank and its collaborators receive sequences produced in laboratories throughout the world from more than 100,000 distinct organisms. GenBank continues to grow at an exponential rate, doubling every 10 months. Release 134, produced in February 2003, contained over 29.3 billion nucleotide bases in more than 23.0 million sequences. GenBank is built by direct submissions from individual laboratories, as well as from bulk submissions from large-scale sequencing centers.</p>
              <p>Direct submissions are made to GenBank using <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BankIt/">BankIt</ext-link>, which is a Web-based form, or the stand-alone submission program, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/index.html">Sequin</ext-link>. Upon receipt of a sequence submission, the GenBank staff assigns an Accession number to the sequence and performs quality assurance checks. The submissions are then released to the public database, where the entries are retrievable by <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=Nucleotide">Entrez</ext-link> or downloadable by <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1295">FTP</xref>. Bulk submissions of Expressed Sequence Tag (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1283">EST</xref>), Sequence Tagged Site (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1410">STS</xref>), Genome Survey Sequence (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1305">GSS</xref>), and High-Throughput Genome Sequence (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1311">HTGS</xref>) data are most often submitted by large-scale sequencing centers. The GenBank direct submissions group also processes complete microbial genome sequences.</p>

              <title>History</title>
              <p>Initially, GenBank was built and maintained at Los Alamos National Laboratory (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1329">LANL</xref>). In the early 1990s, this responsibility was awarded to NCBI through congressional mandate. NCBI undertook the task of scanning the literature for sequences and manually typing the sequences into the database. Staff then added annotation to these records, based upon information in the published article. Scanning sequences from the literature and placing them into GenBank is now a rare occurrence. Nearly all of the sequences are now deposited directly by the labs that generate the sequences. This is attributable to, in part, a requirement by most journal publishers that nucleotide sequences are first deposited into publicly available databases (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank) so that the Accession number can be cited and the sequence can be retrieved when the article is published. NCBI began accepting direct submissions to GenBank in 1993 and received data from LANL until 1996. Currently, NCBI receives and processes about 20,000 direct submission sequences per month, in addition to the approximately 200,000 bulk submissions that are processed automatically.</p>

            <sec id="bid.4">
              <title>International Collaboration</title>
              <p>In the mid-1990s, the GenBank database became part of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration with the EMBL database (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">European Bioinformatics Institute</ext-link>, Hinxton, United Kingdom) and the Genome Sequence Database (GSDB; LANL, Los Alamos, NM). Subsequently, the GSDB was removed from the Collaboration (by the National Center for Genome Resources, Santa Fe, NM), and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/">DDBJ</ext-link> (Mishima, Japan) joined the group. Each database has its own set of submission and retrieval tools, but the three databases exchange data daily so that all three databases should contain the same set of sequences. Members of the DDBJ, EMBL, and GenBank staff meet annually to discuss technical issues, and an international advisory board meets with the database staff to provide additional guidance. An entry can only be updated by the database that initially prepared it to avoid conflicting data at the three sites.</p>
              <p>The Collaboration created a <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/collab/FT/index.html">Feature Table Definition</ext-link> that outlines legal features and syntax for the DDBJ, EMBL, and GenBank feature tables. The purpose of this document is to standardize annotation across the databases. The presentation and format of the data are different in the three databases, however, the underlying biological information is the same.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec id="bid.5">
              <title>Confidentiality of Data</title>
              <p>When scientists submit data to GenBank, they have the opportunity to keep their data confidential for a specified period of time. This helps to allay concerns that the availability of their data in GenBank before publication may compromise their work. When the article containing the citation of the sequence or its Accession number is published, the sequence record is released. The database staff request that submitters notify GenBank of the date of publication so that the sequence can be released without delay. The request to release should be sent to <email>gb-admin@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</email>.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec id="bid.6">
              <title>Direct Submissions</title>
              <p>The typical GenBank submission consists of a single, contiguous stretch of DNA or RNA sequence with annotations. The annotations are meant to provide an adequate representation of the biological information in the record. The GenBank <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/collab/FT/index.html">Feature Table Definition</ext-link> describes the various features and subsequent qualifiers agreed upon by the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration.</p>
              <p>Currently, only nucleotide sequences are accepted for direct submission to GenBank. These include mRNA sequences with coding regions, fragments of genomic DNA with a single gene or multiple genes, and ribosomal RNA gene clusters. If part of the nucleotide sequence encodes a protein, a conceptual translation, called a <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1259">CDS</xref> (coding sequence), is annotated. The span of the CDS feature is mapped to the nucleotide sequence encoding the protein. A protein Accession number (/protein_id) is assigned to the translation product, which will subsequently be added to the protein databases.</p>
              <p>Multiple sequences can be submitted together. Such batch submissions of non-related sequences may be processed together but will be displayed in Entrez (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.588">Chapter 15</xref>) as single records. Alternatively, by using the Sequin submission tool (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.538">Chapter 12</xref>), a submitter can specify that several sequences are biologically related. Such sequences are classified as environmental sample sets, population sets, phylogenetic sets, mutation sets, or segmented sets. Each sequence within a set is assigned its own Accession number and can be viewed independently in Entrez. However, with the exception of segmented sets, each set is also indexed within the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=Popset">PopSet</ext-link> division of Entrez, thus allowing scientists to view the relationship between the sequences.</p>
              <p>What defines a set? Environmental sample, population, phylogenetic, and mutation sets all contain a group of sequences that spans the same gene or region of the genome. Environmental samples are derived from a group of unclassified or unknown organisms. A population set contains sequences from different isolates of the same organism. A phylogenetic set contains sequences from different organisms that are used to determine the phylogenetic relationship between them. Sequencing multiple mutations within a single gene gives rise to a mutation set.</p>
              <p>All sets, except segmented sets, may contain an alignment of the sequences within them and might include external sequences already present in the database. In fact, the submitter can begin with an existing alignment to create a submission to the database using the Sequin submission tool. Currently, Sequin accepts <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1290">FASTA</xref>+GAP, <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1373">PHYLIP</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1335">MACAW</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1356">NEXUS</xref> Interleaved, and NEXUS Contiguous alignments. Submitted alignments will be displayed in the PopSet section of Entrez.</p>
              <p>Segmented sets are a collection of noncontiguous sequences that cover a specified genetic region. The most common example is a set of genomic sequences containing <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1287">exon</xref>s from a single gene where part or all of the intervening regions have not been sequenced. Each member record within the set contains the appropriate annotation, exon features in this case. However, the mRNA and CDS will be annotated as joined features across the individual records. Segmented sets themselves can be part of an environmental sample, population, phylogenetic, or mutation set.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec id="bid.7">
              <title>Bulk Submissions: High-Throughput Genomic Sequence (HTGS)</title>
              <p><xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1311">HTGS</xref> entries are submitted in bulk by genome centers, processed by an automated system, and then released to GenBank. Currently, about 30 genome centers are submitting data for a number of organisms, including human, mouse, rat, rice, and <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, the malaria parasite.</p>
              <p><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/HTGS/">HTGS</ext-link> data are submitted in four phases of completion: 0, 1, 2, and 3. Phase 0 sequences are one-to-few reads of a single clone and are not usually assembled into <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1267">contig</xref>s. They are low-quality sequences that are often used to check whether another center is already sequencing a particular clone. Phase 1 entries are assembled into contigs that are separated by sequence gaps, the relative order and orientation of which are not known (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.8">Figure 1</xref>). Phase 2 entries are also unfinished sequences that may or may not contain sequence gaps. If there are gaps, then the contigs are in the correct order and orientation. Phase 3 sequences are of finished quality and have no gaps. For each organism, the group overseeing the sequencing effort determines the definition of finished quality.<fig id="bid.8"><label>1</label><caption><p>Diagram showing the orientation and gaps that might be expected in high-throughput sequence from phases 1, 2, and 3.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch1f1" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>
              <p>Phase 0, 1, and 2 records are in the HTG division of GenBank, whereas phase 3 entries go into the taxonomic division of the organism, for example, PRI (primate) for human. An entry keeps its Accession number as it progresses from one phase to another but receives a new Accession.Version number and a new gi number each time there is a sequence change.</p>
              <sec id="bid.9">
                <title>Submitting Data to the HTG Division</title>
                <p>To submit sequences in bulk to the HTG processing system, a center or group must set up an FTP account by writing to <email>htgs-admin@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</email>. Submitters frequently use two tools to create HTG submissions, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/HTGS/sequininfo.html">Sequin</ext-link> or <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/HTGS/fa2htgsinfo.html">fa2htgs</ext-link>. Both of these tools require <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1290">FASTA</xref>-formatted sequence, i.e., a definition line beginning with a &ldquo;greater than&rdquo; sign (&ldquo;&gt;&rdquo;) followed by a unique identifier for the sequence. The raw sequence appears on the lines after the definition line. For sequences composed of contigs separated by gaps, a <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/HTGS/sequininfo.html">modified FASTA format</ext-link> is used. In addition, Sequin users must modify the Sequin configuration file so that the HTG genome center features are enabled.</p>
                <p>fa2htgs is a command-line program that is downloaded to the user's computer. The submitter invokes a script with a series of parameters (arguments) to create a submission. It has an advantage over Sequin in that it can be set up by the user to create submissions in bulk from multiple files.</p>
                <p>Submissions to HTG must contain three identifiers that are used to track each HTG record: the genome center tag, the sequence name, and the Accession number. The genome center tag is assigned by NCBI and is generally the FTP account login name. The sequence name is a unique identifier that is assigned by the submitter to a particular clone or entry and must be unique within the group's submissions. When a sequence is first submitted, it has only a sequence name and genome center tag; the Accession number is assigned during processing. All updates to that entry must include the center tag, sequence name, and Accession number, or processing will fail.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="bid.10">
                <title>The HTG Processing Pathway</title>
                <p>Submitters deposit HTGS sequences in the form of Seq-submit files generated by Sequin, fa2htgs, or their own <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1242">ASN.1</xref> dumper tool into the SEQSUBMIT directory of their FTP account. Every morning, scripts automatically pick up the files from the FTP site and copy them to the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/HTGS/processing.html">processing</ext-link> pathway, as well as to an archive. Once processing is complete and if there are no errors in the submission, the files are automatically loaded into GenBank. The processing time is related to the number of submissions that day; therefore, processing can take from one to many hours.</p>
                <p>Entries can fail HTG processing because of three types of problems:
                  <list list-type="arabic">
                    <list-item id="bid.11">
                      <label>1</label>
                      <p>Formatting: submissions are not in the proper Seq-submit format.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item id="bid.12">
                      <label>2</label>
                      <p>Identification: submissions may be missing the genome center tag, 
                      sequence name, or Accession number, or this information is incorrect.</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item id="bid.13">
                      <label>3</label>
                      <p>Data: submissions have problems with the data and therefore fail 
                      the validator checks.</p>
                    </list-item>
                  </list>
                </p>
                <p>When submissions fail HTG processing, a GenBank annotator sends email to the sequencing center, describing the problem and asking the center to submit a corrected entry. Annotators do not fix incorrect submissions; this ensures that the staff of the submitting genome center fixes the problems in their database as well.</p>
                <p>The processing pathway also generates reports. For successful submissions, two files are generated: one contains the submission in GenBank flat file format (without the sequence); and another is a status report file. The status report file, ac4htgs, contains the genome center, sequence name, Accession number, phase, create date, and update date for the submission. Submissions that fail processing receive an error file with a short description of the error(s) that prevented processing. The GenBank annotator also sends email to the submitter, explaining the errors in further detail.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="bid.14">
                <title>Additional Quality Assurance</title>
                <p>When successful submissions are loaded into GenBank, they undergo additional validation checks. If GenBank annotators find errors, they write to the submitters, asking them to fix these errors and submit an update.</p>
              </sec>
            </sec>
            <sec id="bid.1738">
              <title>Whole Genome Shotgun Sequences (WGS)</title>
              <p>Genome centers are taking multiple approaches to sequencing complete genomes from a number of organisms. In addition to the traditional clone-based sequencing whose data are being submitted to HTGS, these centers are also using a <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/GenBank/wgs.html">WGS</ext-link> approach to sequence the genome. The shotgun sequencing reads are assembled into contigs, which are now being accepted for inclusion in GenBank. WGS contig assemblies may be updated as the sequencing project progresses and new assemblies are computed. WGS sequence records may also contain annotation, similar to other GenBank records.</p>
              <p>Each sequencing project is assigned a stable project ID, which is made up of four letters. The Accession number for a WGS sequence contains the project ID, a two-digit version number, and six digits for the contig ID. For instance, a project would be assigned an Accession number AAAX00000000. The first assembly version would be AAAX01000000. The last six digits of this ID identify individual contigs. A master record for each assembly is created. This master record contains information that is common among all records of the sequencing project, such as the biological source, submitter, and publication information. There is also a link to the range of Accession numbers for the individual contigs in this assembly.</p>

			Expressed Sequence Tags (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1283">EST</xref>), Sequence Tagged Sites (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1410">STS</xref>s), and Genome Survey Sequences (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1305">GSS</xref>s) sequences are generally submitted in a batch and are usually part of a large sequencing project devoted to a particular genome. These entries have a streamlined submission process and undergo minimal processing before being loaded to GenBank.</p>

However, they can also be longer sequences that are obtained by differential display or Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) experiments. The common feature of all ESTs is that little is known about them; therefore, they lack feature annotation.</p>

In addition, they define a specific location on the genome and are, therefore, useful for mapping.</p>

              <p>EST, STS, and GSS sequences reside in their respective divisions within GenBank, rather than in the taxonomic division of the organism. The sequences are maintained within GenBank in the dbEST, dbSTS, and dbGSS databases.</p>
              <sec id="bid.16">
                <title>Submitting Data to dbEST, dbSTS, or dbGSS</title>
                <p>Because of the large numbers of sequences that are submitted at once, dbEST, dbSTS, and dbGSS entries are stored in relational databases where information that is common to all sequences can be shared. Submissions consist of several files containing the common information, plus a file of the sequences themselves. The three types of submissions have different requirements, but all include a Publication file and a Contact file. See the<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST/"> dbEST</ext-link>, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbSTS/"> dbSTS</ext-link>, and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbGSS/"> dbGSS</ext-link> pages for the specific requirements for each type of submission.</p>
                <p>In general, users generate the appropriate files for the submission type and then email the files to <email>batch-sub@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</email>. If the files are too big for email, they can be deposited into a FTP account. Upon receipt, the files are examined by a GenBank annotator, who fixes any errors when possible or contacts the submitter to request corrected files. Once the files are satisfactory, they are loaded into the appropriate database and assigned Accession numbers. Additional formatting errors may be detected at this step by the data-loading software, such as double quotes anywhere in the file or invalid characters in the sequences. Again, if the annotator cannot fix the errors, a request for a corrected submission is sent to the user. After all problems are resolved, the entries are loaded into GenBank.</p>

              <title>Bulk Submissions: HTC and FLIC</title>
              <p>HTC records are High-Throughput cDNA/mRNA submissions that are similar to ESTs but often contain more information. For example, HTC entries often have a systematic gene name (not necessarily an official gene name) that is related to the lab or center that submitted them, and the longest open reading frame is often annotated as a coding region.</p>
              <p>FLIC records, Full-Length Insert cDNA, contain the entire sequence of a cloned cDNA/mRNA. Therefore, FLICs are generally longer, and sometimes even full-length, mRNAs. They are usually annotated with genes and coding regions, although these may be lab systematic names rather than functional names.</p>
              <sec id="bid.1739">
                <title>HTC Submissions</title>
                <p>HTC entries are usually generated with <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/index.html">Sequin</ext-link> or <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/table.html">tbl2asn</ext-link>, and the files are emailed to <email>gb-sub@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</email>. If the files are too big for email, then by prior arrangement, the submitter can deposit the files by FTP and send a notification to <email>gb-admin@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</email> that files are on the FTP site.</p>
                <p>HTC entries undergo the same validation and processing as non-bulk submissions. Once processing is complete, the records are loaded into GenBank and are available in Entrez and other retrieval systems.</p>

                <title>FLIC Submissions</title>
                <p>FLICs are processed via an automated FLIC processing system that is based on the HTG automated processing system. Submitters use the program tbl2asn to generate their submissions. As with HTG submissions, submissions to the automated FLIC processing system must contain three identifiers: the genome center tag, the sequence name (SeqId), and the Accession number. The genome center tag is assigned by NCBI and is generally the FTP account login name. The sequence name is a unique identifier that is assigned by the submitter to a particular clone or entry and must be unique within the group's FLIC submissions. When a sequence is first submitted, it has only a sequence name and genome center tag; the Accession number is assigned during processing. All updates to that entry include the center tag, sequence name, and Accession number, or processing will fail.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="bid.1741">
                <title>The FLIC Processing Pathway</title>
                <p>The FLIC processing system is analogous to the HTG processing system. Submitters deposit their submissions in the FLICSEQSUBMIT directory of their FTP account and notify us that the submissions are there. We then run the scripts to pick up the files from the FTP site and copy them to the processing pathway, as well as to an archive. Once processing is complete and if there are no errors in the submission, the files are automatically loaded into GenBank.</p>
                <p>As with HTG submissions, FLIC entries can fail for three reasons: problems with the format, problems with the identification of the record (the genome center, the SeqId, or the Accession number), or problems with the data itself. When submissions fail FLIC processing, a GenBank annotator sends email to the sequencing center, describing the problem and asking the center to submit a corrected entry. Annotators do not fix incorrect submissions; this ensures that the staff of the submitting genome center fixes the problems in their database as well. At the completion of processing, reports are generated and deposited in the submitter's FTP account, as described for HTG submissions.</p>

              <p>Direct submissions to GenBank are prepared using one of two submission tools, BankIt or Sequin.</p>
              <sec id="bid.19">
                <title>BankIt</title>
                <p><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BankIt/">BankIt</ext-link> is a Web-based form that is a convenient and easy way to submit a small number of sequences with minimal annotation to GenBank. To complete the form, a user is prompted to enter submitter information, the nucleotide sequence, biological source information, and features and annotation pertinent to the submission. BankIt has extensive <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BankIt/help.html">Help</ext-link> documentation to guide the submitter. Included with the Help document is a set of annotation examples that detail the types of information that are required for each type of submission. After the information is entered into the form, BankIt transforms this information into a GenBank <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1294">flatfile</xref> for review. In addition, a number of quality assurance and validation checks ensure that the sequence submitted to GenBank is of the highest quality. The submitter is asked to include spans (sequence coordinates) for the coding regions and other features and to include amino acid sequence for the proteins that derive from these coding regions. The BankIt validator compares the amino acid sequence provided by the submitter with the conceptual translation of the coding region based on the provided spans. If there is a discrepancy, the submitter is requested to fix the problem, and the process is halted until the error is resolved. To prevent the deposit of sequences that contain cloning vector sequence, a <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1246">BLAST</xref> similarity search is performed on the sequence, comparing it to the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/VecScreen/VecScreen.html">VecScreen</ext-link> database. If there is a match to this database, the user is asked to remove the contaminating vector sequence from their submission or provide an explanation as to why the screen was positive. Completed forms are saved in ASN.1 format, and the entry is submitted to the GenBank processing queue. The submitter receives confirmation by email, indicating that the submission process was successful.</p>

It is a stand-alone application available on NCBI's <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/sequin/">FTP</ext-link> site. Sequin creates submissions from nucleotide and amino acid sequences in FASTA format with tagged biological source information in the FASTA definition line. As in BankIt, Sequin has the ability to predict the spans of coding regions. Alternatively, a submitter can specify the spans of their coding regions in a <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/table.html">five-column, tab-delimited table</ext-link> and import that table into Sequin. For submitting multiple, related sequences, e.g., those in a phylogenetic or population study, Sequin accepts the output of many popular multiple sequence-alignment packages, including FASTA+GAP, PHYLIP, MACAW, NEXUS Interleaved, and NEXUS Contiguous. It also allows users to annotate features in a single record or a set of records globally. For more information on Sequin, see <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.538">Chapter 12</xref>.

                <p>All direct submissions to GenBank, created either by Sequin or BankIt, are processed by the GenBank annotation staff. The first step in processing submissions is called triage. Within 48 hours of receipt, the database staff reviews the submission to determine whether it meets the minimal criteria for incorporation into GenBank and then assigns an Accession number to each sequence. All sequences must be &gt;50 bp in length and be sequenced by, or on behalf of, the group submitting the sequence. GenBank will not accept sequences constructed <italic>in silico</italic>; noncontiguous sequences containing internal, unsequenced spacers; or sequences for which there is not a physical counterpart, such as those derived from a mix of genomic DNA and mRNA. Submissions are also checked to determine whether they are new sequences or updates to sequences submitted previously. After receiving Accession numbers, the sequences are put into a queue for more extensive processing and review by the annotation staff.</p>

Annotators also ensure that the source organism name and lineage are present, and that they are represented in NCBI's taxonomy database. If either of these is not true, the submitter is asked to correct the problem. Entries are also subjected to a series of BLAST similarity searches to compare the annotation with existing sequences in GenBank.</p>

                <p>The annotation staff uses a variety of tools to process and update sequence submissions. Sequence records are edited with Sequin, which allows staff to annotate large sets of records by global editing rather than changing each record individually. This is truly a time saver because more than 100 entries can be edited in a single step (see <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.538">Chapter 12</xref> on Sequin for more details). Records are stored in a database that is accessed through a queue management tool that automates some of the processing steps, such as looking up taxonomy and PubMed data, starting BLAST jobs, and running automatic validation checks. Hence, when an annotator is ready to start working on an entry, all of this information is ready to view. In addition, all of the correspondence between GenBank staff and the submitter is stored with the entry. For updates to entries already present in the public database, the live version of the entry is retrieved from ID, and after making changes, the annotator loads the entry back into the public database. This entry is available to the public immediately after loading.</p>

              <title>Microbial Genomes</title>
              <p>The GenBank direct submissions group has processed more than 50 complete microbial genomes since 1996. These genomes are relatively small in size compared with their eukaryotic counterparts, ranging from five hundred thousand to five million bases. Nonetheless, these genomes can contain thousands of genes, coding regions, and structural RNAs; therefore, processing and presenting them correctly is a challenge. Currently, the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration has a 350-kilobase (kb) upper size limit for sequence entries. Because a complete bacterial genome is larger than this arbitrary limit, it must be split into pieces. GenBank routinely splits complete microbial genomes into 10-kb pieces with a 60-bp overlap between pieces. Each piece contains approximately 10 genes. A CON entry, containing instructions on how to put the pieces back together, is also made. The CON entry contains descriptor information, such as source organism and references, as well as a join statement providing explicit instructions on how to generate the complete genome from the pieces. The Accession number assigned to the CON record is also added as a secondary Accession number on each of the pieces that make up the complete genome (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.37">Figure 2</xref>).<fig id="bid.37"><label>2</label><caption><title>A GenBank CON entry for a complete bacterial genome.</title><p>The information toward the <italic>bottom</italic> of the record describes how to generate the complete genome from the pieces.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch1f2" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>

                <p>Submitters of complete genomes are encouraged to contact us at <email>genomes@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</email> before preparing their entries. A FTP account is required to submit large files, and the submission should be deposited at least 1 month before publication to allow for processing time and coordinated release before publication. In addition, submitters are required to follow certain guidelines, such as providing unique identifiers for proteins and systematic names for all genes. Entries should be prepared with the submission tool <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/table.html">tbl2asn</ext-link>, a utility that is part of the Sequin package (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.538">Chapter 12</xref>). This utility creates an ASN.1 submission file from a five-column, tab-delimited file containing feature annotation, a FASTA-formatted nucleotide sequence, and an optional FASTA-formatted protein sequence.</p>
                <p>Complete genome submissions are reviewed by a member of the GenBank annotation staff to ensure that the annotation and gene and protein identifiers are correct, and that the entry is in proper GenBank format. Any problems with the entry are resolved through communication with the submitter. Once the record is complete, the genome is carefully split into its component pieces. The genome is split so that none of the breaks occurs within a gene or coding region. A member of the annotation staff performs quality assurance checks on the set of genome pieces to ensure that they are correct and representative of the complete genome. The pieces are then loaded into GenBank, and the CON record is created.</p>

              <p>The vast amount of publicly available data from the human genome project and other genome sequencing efforts is a valuable resource for
scientists throughout the world. A laboratory studying a particular gene
or gene family may have sequenced numerous cDNAs but has neither the
resources nor inclination to sequence large genomic regions containing
the genes, especially when the sequence is available in public
databases. The researcher might choose then to download genomic
sequences from GenBank and perform experimental analyses on these
sequences. However, because this researcher did not perform the
sequencing, the sequence, with its new annotations, cannot be submitted
to DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank. This is unfortunate because important scientific
information is being excluded from the public databases. To address this
problem, the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration
established a separate section of the database for such TPA (see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/tpa.html">Third Party Annotation Sequence Database</ext-link>).</p>
              <p>All sequences in the TPA database are derived from the publicly
available collection of sequences in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank. Researchers can
submit both new and alternative annotations of genomic sequence to
GenBank. TPA entries can be also created by combining the exon sequences
from genomic sequences or by making contigs of EST sequences to make
mRNA sequences. TPA submissions must use sequence data that are already
represented in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank, have annotation that is experimentally
supported, and appear in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. TPA
sequences will be released to the public database only when their
Accession numbers and/or sequence data appear in a peer-reviewed
publication in a biological journal. </p>

              <title>Summary</title>
              <p>PubMed is a database developed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the National Library of Medicine (NLM), one of the institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The database was designed to provide access to citations (with abstracts) from biomedical journals. Subsequently, a linking feature was added to provide access to full-text journal articles at Web sites of participating publishers, as well as to other related Web resources. PubMed is the bibliographic component of the NCBI's Entrez retrieval system.</p>

                <p><xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1387">PubMed</xref>'s primary data resource is <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1339">MEDLINE</xref>, the NLM's premier bibliographic database covering the fields of medicine, nursing, dentistry, veterinary medicine, the health care system, and the preclinical sciences, such as molecular biology. MEDLINE contains bibliographic citations and author abstracts from about 4,600 biomedical journals published in the United States and 70 other countries. The database contains about 12 million citations dating back to the mid-1960s. Coverage is worldwide, but most records are from English-language sources or have English abstracts.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="bid.45">
                <title>Non-MEDLINE</title>
                <p>In addition to MEDLINE citations, PubMed<sup>&reg;</sup> provides access to non-MEDLINE resources, such as out-of-scope citations, citations that precede MEDLINE selection, and PubMed Central (PMC; see <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.457">Chapter 9</xref>) citations. Together, these are often referred to as &ldquo;PubMed-only citations.&rdquo; Out-of-scope citations are primarily from general science and chemistry journals that contain life sciences articles indexed for MEDLINE, e.g., the plate tectonics or astrophysics articles from <italic>Science</italic> magazine. Publishers can also submit citations with publication dates that precede the journal's selection for MEDLINE indexing, usually because they want to create links to older content. PMC citations are taken from life sciences journals (MEDLINE or non-MEDLINE) that submit full-text articles to PMC. In addition to the incorporation of PubMed-only citations, PubMed has been enhanced recently by the incorporation of citations from the following unique databases: HealthSTAR, AIDSLINE, HISTLINE, SPACELINE, BIOETHICSLINE, and POPLINE.</p>
                <p>In response to new approaches to electronic publishing, PubMed can now also accommodate articles published electronically in advance of being collected into an issue. We refer to these citations as &ldquo;ahead of print&rdquo; or &ldquo;epub&rdquo; citations.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="bid.46">
                <title>Journal Selection Criteria</title>
                <p>All content in PubMed ultimately comes from publishers of biomedical journals, and journals that are to be included in MEDLINE are subject to a selection process. The <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/jsel.html">Fact Sheet</ext-link> on <italic>Journal Selection for Index Medicus<sup>&reg;</sup>/MEDLINE<sup>&reg;</sup></italic> describes the journal selection policy, criteria, and procedures for data submission.</p>

            <sec id="bid.47">
              <title>Electronic Data Submission</title>
              <p>Electronic data submission benefits everyone: publishers, the NLM, and users. For the NLM, it eliminates the tremendous costs associated with entering data by hand. For publishers and users, it means that newly published data appear rapidly and accurately in PubMed. Some publishers are now making pre-publication material available before it is formally published (&ldquo;ahead of print&rdquo; or &ldquo;epub&rdquo; citations); others are publishing electronic-only journals. By close collaboration with the publisher, the citations for these publications can appear in PubMed on the same day as the article is published.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, electronic data submission allows publishers to create links from abstracts in PubMed to the full text of the appropriate articles available on their own Web site. This can be achieved using LinkOut (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.650">Chapter 17</xref>). Both subscribers to the journals and other PubMed users can access the full text according to criteria that are determined by the publishers, increasing traffic to their sites.</p>
              <p>Although the NLM works with many publishers directly, some publishers contract with commercial data aggregators, companies that prepare and submit the publisher's data to the NLM. Many aggregators also host publisher data on their Web sites.</p>
              <sec id="bid.48">
                <title>Electronic Data Submission Process</title>
                <p>All electronic data are supplied via <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1295">FTP</xref> to NCBI in XML format, in accordance with the NLM's specifications (document type definition, or <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1277">DTD</xref>). These specifications can be found in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/spec.html">NLM Standard Publisher Data Format</ext-link> document. The document includes information on XML tag descriptions, how to handle special characters (e.g., &alpha; or &beta;), examples of tagged records, the PubMed DTD, and a FAQ section for participating or potential data providers. Publishers or other data providers who want to submit electronic data should write to: <email>publisher@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</email>.</p>
                <p>NCBI staff will guide new data providers through the approval process for file submission. New providers are asked to submit test files, which are then checked for XML formatting and syntax and for bibliographic accuracy and completeness. The files are revised and resubmitted as many times as necessary until all criteria are met. Once approved, a private account is set up on our FTP site to receive new journal issues, or in the case of online publications, individual articles as they are added to the publisher's Web site. We run a file-loading script that automatically processes the files daily, Monday through Friday at approximately 9:00 a.m. (Eastern Time). The new citations are assigned a PubMed ID number (PMID), a confirmation report is sent to the provider, and the new citations usually become available in PubMed sometime after 11:00 a.m. the next day, Tuesday through Saturday.</p>
                <p>After posting in PubMed, the citations are forwarded to NLM's Indexing Section for bibliographic data verification and for the addition of subject indexing terms from Medical Subject Headings [<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1341">MeSH</xref>]. This process can take several weeks, after which time completed citations flow back into PubMed, replacing the originally submitted data.</p>

              <title>Database Management and Hardware</title>
              <p>PubMed is one of the NCBI databases within the relational database management system, <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1282">Entrez</xref> (see <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.588">Chapter 15</xref>). Entrez is a text-based search and retrieval system based on in-house software that uses an indexing system for rapid retrieval of information.</p>
              <p>Requests for NCBI services, including PubMed, are first proxied through three load-balanced Dell PowerEdge 1650 servers, each with two central processing units. The proxy servers, in turn, load-balance requests forwarded on to the Web servers for PubMed and other NCBI services.</p>
              <p>The PubMed Web servers comprise eight Dell PowerEdge 8450 servers. The Dell servers have eight central processing units, 8 GB of memory, and about 300 GB of disk space and run the Linux operating system.</p>
              <p>The Web servers retrieve PubMed records from two Sybase SQL database servers, which run on Sun Enterprise 450s. To accommodate the data volume output by PubMed and other Web-based services, the NLM has a high-speed connection (OC-3, up to 155 Mbits/sec) to the Internet, as well as a 622 Mbits/sec connection (OC-12) to Internet2, the noncommercial network used by many leading research universities.</p>

                <title>PubMed Citation Status and Assignment of MeSH Terms</title>
                <p>Citations in PubMed are assigned one of three citation status tags that display next to the PubMed ID (PMID) numbers on all PubMed citations. The citation status tags indicate the citation's stage in the MEDLINE indexing process. The three tags are:</p>
                <p><bold>[PubMed - as supplied by publisher]</bold>: This tag is displayed on citations added recently to PubMed via electronic submission from a publisher (which may or may not move on for MEDLINE MeSH indexing).</p>
                <p><bold>[PubMed - in process]</bold>: This tag is displayed on citations that have had the first stage of quality review to verify that the journal, date, volume, and/or issue are correct. They will be reviewed for other accurate bibliographic data at the article level (e.g., pagination, authors, article title, and abstract) and indexed, i.e., the articles will be reviewed and MeSH vocabulary will be assigned (if the subject of the article is within the scope of MEDLINE).</p>
                <p><bold>[PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]</bold>: This tag is displayed on citations that have been indexed with MeSH, Publication Types, Registry Numbers, etc., and have been completely reviewed for accurate bibliographic data. This is an intellectual process of assigning controlled vocabulary terms to describe the contents of the journal article and verifying other aspects of the citation data.</p>
                <p>Most citations that are received electronically from publishers progress through &ldquo;in process&rdquo; status to MEDLINE status. Those citations not indexed for MEDLINE remain tagged [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]. Citations with &ldquo;in process&rdquo; status proceed to MEDLINE status after MeSH terms, publication types, sequence Accession numbers, and other indexing data are added.</p>
                <p>All records are added to PubMed Monday through Friday and become available for viewing Tuesday through Saturday.

                <title>The Automatic Computer Indexing Process</title>
                <p>The aim of the computer indexing process is to automatically create multiple machine-readable access points that refer to the different components of the journal citations for use when searching PubMed. The citations are loaded into PubMed from both the NLM Data Creation and Maintenance System (DCMS) and directly from journal publishers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.53">Figure 1</xref>). Both sources are in XML.<fig id="bid.53"><label>1</label><caption><title>A schematic representation of PubMed data flow.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch2f1" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>
                <p>During the computer indexing process, the citation information is broken down into index fields such as Journal Name, Author Name, and Title/Abstract. The words in each of the fields are checked against the corresponding index (i.e., title words in a new citation are looked up in the Title/Abstract Index). If the word already exists, the PMID of the citation is listed with that index term. If the word is a new one for the Index, it is added as a new Index term, and the PMID is listed alongside it. (In the first instance that the term already exists, the new term will have only this one citation associated with it; this is how the PubMed indexes grow.)</p>
                <p>Each PubMed citation is, therefore, associated with several indexes, and in cases similar to the Title/Abstract Index, many different index terms can refer back to a single citation. Likewise, commonly used terms will refer to thousands of citations (the term &ldquo;cell&rdquo;, for example, is found in the Title/Abstract of 1,092,124 citations at the time of this writing). The Field Indexes can be browsed by using PubMed's <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=IndexView&amp;DB=PubMed">Preview/Index</ext-link> function.</p>

                <title>Search Rules and Field Abbreviations</title>
                <p>It is possible to override PubMed's Automatic Term Mapping by using search rules, syntax, and qualifying terms with search field abbreviations.</p>
                <p>The <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1253">Boolean</xref> operators AND, OR, and NOT must be entered in uppercase letters and are processed left to right. Nesting of search terms is possible by enclosing concepts in parentheses. The terms inside the set of parentheses will be processed as a unit and then incorporated into the overall strategy. Terms may be qualified using PubMed's <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/help/pmhelp.html#SearchFieldDescriptionsandTags">Search Field Descriptions and Tags</ext-link>. Each search term should be followed by the appropriate search field tag, which indicates which field will be searched:</p>
                <p>Search term: o'malley [au] will search only the author field. Specifying the field precludes the Automatic Term Mapping, which would result in the search o'malley[All Fields] if the field were not specified. Similarly, using the search term Cell [Journal] avoids using the MeSH Translation Table, which would interpret Cell as only a text word and MeSH term.</p>

                  <title>Simple Searching</title>
                  <p>A simple search can be conducted from the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi">PubMed</ext-link> homepage by entering terms in the query box and pressing Enter from the keyboard or clicking on the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Go</named-content> button on the screen.</p>
                  <p>If more than one term is entered in the query box, PubMed will go through the Automatic Term Mapping protocol described in the previous section, first looking for all the terms, as typed, to find an exact match. If the exact phrase is not found, PubMed clips a term off the end and repeats Automatic Term Mapping, again looking for an exact match, but this time to the abbreviated query. This continues until none of the words are found in any one of the translation tables. In this case, PubMed combines terms (with the AND Boolean operator) and applies the Automatic Term Mapping process to each individual word. PubMed ignores <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/help/pmhelp.html#Stopwords">Stopwords</ext-link>, such as &ldquo;about&rdquo;, &ldquo;of&rdquo;, or &ldquo;what&rdquo;. People can also apply their own Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) to multiple search terms; the Boolean operators must be in uppercase.</p>

                  </boxed-text>
                  <p>If a phrase of more than two terms is not found in any translation table, then the last word of the phrase is dropped, and the remainder of the phrase is sent through the entire process again. This continues, removing one word at a time, until a match is found.</p>
                  <p>If there is no match found during the Automatic Term Mapping process, the individual terms will be combined with AND and searched in All Fields.</p>

              <title>Summary</title>
              <p>The resources provided by NCBI for studying the three-dimensional (3D) structures of proteins center around two databases: the Molecular Modeling Database (MMDB), which provides structural information about individual proteins; and the Conserved Domain Database (CDD), which provides a directory of sequence and structure alignments representing conserved functional domains within proteins(<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1255">CD</xref>s). Together, these two databases allow scientists to retrieve and view structures, find structurally similar proteins to a protein of interest, and identify conserved functional sites.</p>
              <p>To enable scientists to accomplish these tasks, NCBI has integrated MMDB and CDD into the Entrez retrieval system (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.588">Chapter 15</xref>). In addition, structures can be found by BLAST, because sequences derived from MMDB structures have been included in the BLAST databases (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.610">Chapter 16</xref>). Once a protein structure has been identified, the domains within the protein, as well as domain &ldquo;neighbors&rdquo; (i.e., those with similar structure) can be found. For novel data not yet included in Entrez, there are separate search services available.</p>
              <p>Protein structures can be visualized using Cn3D, an interactive 3D graphic modeling tool. Details of the structure, such as ligand-binding sites, can be scrutinized and highlighted. Cn3D can also display multiple sequence alignments based on sequence and/or structural similarity among related sequences, 3D domains, or members of a CDD family. Cn3D images and alignments can be manipulated easily and exported to other applications for presentation or further analysis.</p>

Once found, any structure of interest can be viewed using <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/CN3D/cn3d.shtml">Cn3D</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.237">2</xref>), a piece of software that can be freely downloaded for Mac, PC, and <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1426">UNIX</xref> platforms.</p>
              <p>Often used in conjunction with <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1264">Cn3D</xref> is the Vector Alignment Search Tool (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1430">VAST</xref>; Refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.238">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.239">4</xref>). <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/VAST/vast.shtml">VAST</ext-link> is used to precompute &ldquo;structure neighbors&rdquo; or structures similar to each MMDB entry. For people that have a set of 3D coordinates for a protein not yet in MMDB, there is also a <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/VAST/vastsearch.html">VAST search service</ext-link>. The output of the precomputed VAST searches is a list of structure records, each representing one of the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/VAST/nrpdb.html">Non-Redundant PDB chain</ext-link> sets (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1360">nr-PDB</xref>), which can also be downloaded. There are four clustered subsets of MMDB that compose nr-PDB, each consisting of clusters having a preset level of sequence similarity.</p>
              <p>The structures within MMDB are now being linked to the NCBI Taxonomy database (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.246">Chapter 4</xref>). Known as the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/PDBEAST/pdbeast.shtml">PDBeast</ext-link> project, this effort makes it possible to find: (1) all MMDB structures from a particular organism; and (2) all structures within a node of the taxonomy tree (such as lizards or <italic>Bacillus)</italic>, which launches the Taxonomy Browser showing the number of MMDB records in each node.</p>
              <p>The second database within the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Structure</named-content> resources is the Conserved Domain Database (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1257">CDD</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.240">Ref. 5</xref>), originally based largely on <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1368">Pfam</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1403">SMART</xref>, collections of alignments that represent functional domains conserved across evolution. CDD now also contains the alignments of the NCBI COG database, the NCBI Library of Ancient Domains (LOAD) along with new curated alignments assembled at NCBI. CDD can be searched from the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml">CDD</ext-link> page in several ways, including by a domain keyword search. Three tools have been developed to assist in analysis of CDD: (1) the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi">CD-Search</ext-link>, which uses a <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1246">BLAST</xref>-based algorithm to search the position-specific scoring matrices (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1386">PSSM</xref>) of CDD alignments; (2) the CD-Browser, which provides a graphic display of domains of interest, along with the sequence alignment; and (3) the Conserved Domain Architecture Retrieval Tool (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/lexington/lexington.cgi?cmd=rps">CDART</ext-link>), which searches for proteins with similar domain architectures.</p>
              <p>All the above databases and tools are discussed in more detail in other parts of this Chapter, including tips on how to make the best use of them.</p>

                <p>To build MMDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.236">1</xref>), 3D structure data are retrieved from the PDB database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.241">6</xref>) administered by the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1391">RCSB</xref>). In all cases, the structures in MMDB have been determined by experimental methods, primarily X-ray crystallography and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1359">NMR</xref>) spectroscopy. Theoretical structure models are omitted. The data in each record are then checked for agreement between the atomic coordinates and the primary sequence, and the sequence data are then extracted from the coordinate set. The resulting agreement between sequence and structure allows the record to be linked efficiently into searches and alignment displays involving other NCBI databases.</p>
                <p>The data are converted into <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1242">ASN.1</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.242">7</xref>), which can be parsed easily and can also accept numerous annotations to the structure data. In contrast to a PDB record, a MMDB record in ASN.1 contains all necessary bonding information in addition to sequence information, allowing consistent display of the 3D structure using Cn3D. The annotations provided in the PDB record by the submitting authors are added, along with uniformly defined secondary structure and domain features. These features support structure-based similarity searches using VAST. Finally, two coordinate subsets are added to the record: one containing only backbone atoms, and one representing a single-conformer model in cases where multiple conformations or structures were present in the PDB record. Both of these additions further simplify viewing both an individual structure and its alignments with structure neighbors in Cn3D.

                <title>Annotation of 3D Domains</title>
                <p>After initial processing, 3D domains are automatically identified within each MMDB record. 3D domains are annotations on individual MMDB structures that define the boundaries of compact substructures contained within them. In this way, they are similar to secondary structure annotations that define the boundaries of helical or &beta;-strand substructures. Because proteins are often similar at the level of domains, VAST compares each 3D domain to every other one and to complete polypeptide chains. The results are stored in Entrez as a <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Related 3D Domain</named-content> link.</p>
                <p>To identify 3D domains within a polypeptide chain, MMDB's domain parser searches for one or more breakpoints in the structure. These breakpoints fall between major secondary structure elements such that the ratio of intra- to interdomain contacts remains above a set threshold. The 3D domains identified in this way provide a means to both increase the sensitivity of structure neighbor calculations and also present 3D superpositions based on compact domains as well as on complete polypeptide chains. They are not intended to represent domains identified by comparative sequence and structure analysis, nor do they represent modules that recur in related proteins, although there is often good agreement between domain boundaries identified by these methods.</p>

                <title>Links to Other NCBI Resources</title>
                <p>After initially processing the PDB record, structure staff add a number of links and other information that further integrate the MMDB record with other NCBI resources. To begin, the sequence information extracted from the PDB record is entered into the Entrez Protein and/or Nucleotide databases as appropriate, providing a means to retrieve the structure information from sequence searches. As with all sequences in Entrez, precomputed BLAST searches are then performed on these sequences, linking them to other molecules of similar sequence. For proteins, these BLAST neighbors may be different than those determined by VAST; whereas VAST uses a conservative significance threshold, the structural similarities it detects often represent remote relationships not detectable by sequence comparison. The literature citations in the PDB record are linked to PubMed so that Entrez searches can allow access to the original descriptions of the structure determinations. Finally, semiautomatic processing of the &ldquo;source&rdquo; field of the PDB record provides links to the NCBI Taxonomy database. Although these links normally follow the genus and species information given, in some cases this information is either absent in the PDB record or refers only to how a sample was obtained. In these cases, the staff manually enters the appropriate taxonomy links.</p>

                <title>What Is a Conserved Domain (CD)?</title>
                <p>CDs are recurring units in polypeptide chains (sequence and structure motifs), the extents of which can be determined by comparative analysis. Molecular evolution uses such domains as building blocks and these may be recombined in different arrangements to make different proteins with different functions. The CDD contains sequence alignments that define the features that are conserved within each domain family. Therefore, the CDD serves as a classification resource that groups proteins based on the presence of these predefined domains. CDD entries often name the domain family and describe the role of conserved residues in binding or catalysis. Conserved domains are displayed in MMDB Structure summaries and link to a sequence alignment showing other proteins in which the domain is conserved, which may provide clues on protein function.</p>

                <title>Sources of Primary Data</title>
                <p>The collections of domain alignments in the CDD are imported either from two databases outside of the NCBI, named Pfam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.243">8</xref>) and SMART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.244">9</xref>); from the NCBI COB database; from another NCBI collection named LOAD; and from a database curated by the CDD staff. The first task is to identify the underlying sequences in each collection and then link these sequences to the corresponding ones in Entrez. If the CDD staff cannot find the Accession numbers for the sequences in the records from the source databases, they locate appropriate sequences using BLAST. Particular attention is paid to any resulting match that is linked to a structure record in MMDB, and the staff substitute alignment rows with such sequences whenever possible. After the staff imports a collection, they then choose a sequence that best represents the family. Whenever possible, the staff chooses a representative that has a structure record in MMDB.</p>

                <title>The Position-specific Score Matrix (PSSM)</title>
                <p>Once imported and constructed, each domain alignment in CDD is used to calculate a model sequence, called a <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1266">consensus sequence</xref>, for each CD. The consensus sequence lists the most frequently found residue in each position in the alignment; however, for a sequence position to be included in the consensus sequence, it must be present in at least 50% of the aligned sequences. Aligned columns covered by the consensus sequence are then used to calculate a <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1386">PSSM</xref>, which memorizes the degree to which particular residues are conserved at each position in the sequence. Once calculated, the PSSM is stored with the alignment and becomes part of the CDD.

PSI-BLAST finds sequences similar to the query and uses the resulting alignments to build a PSSM for the query. With this PSSM the database is scanned again to draw in more hits and further refine the scoring model. RPS-BLAST uses a query sequence to search a database of precalculated PSSMs and report significant hits in a single pass. The role of the PSSM has changed from &ldquo;query&rdquo; to &ldquo;subject&rdquo;; hence, the term &ldquo;reverse&rdquo; in RPS-BLAST.

                <p>In 2002, NCBI released the first group of curated CD records, a new and expanding set of annotated protein multiple sequence alignments and corresponding  structure alignments. These new records have Accession numbers beginning with  &ldquo;cd&rdquo; and have been added to the default CD-Search database. Most curated CD records are based on existing family descriptions from SMART and Pfam, but the alignments may have been revised extensively by quantitatively using three-dimensional structures and by re-examining the domain extent. In addition, CDD curators annotate conserved functional residues, ligands, and co-factors contained within the structures. They also record evidence for these sites as pointers to relevant literature or to three-dimensional structures exemplifying their properties. These annotations may be viewed using Cn3D and thus provide a direct way of visualizing functional properties of a protein domain in the context  of its three-dimensional structure.

                <title>The Distinction between 3D Domains and CDs</title>
                <p>The term &ldquo;domain&rdquo; refers in general to a distinct functional and/or structural unit of a protein. Each polypeptide chain in MMDB is analyzed for the presence of two classes of domains, and it is important for users to understand the difference between them. One class, called 3D Domains, is based solely on similar, compact substructures, whereas the second class, called Conserved Domains (CDs), is based solely on conserved sequence motifs. These two classifications often agree, because the compact substructures within a protein often correspond to domains joined by recombination in the evolutionary history of a protein. Note that CD links can be identified even when no 3D structures within a family are known. Moreover, 3D Domain links may also indicate relationships either to structures not included in CDD entries or to structures so distantly related that no significant similarity can be found by sequence comparisons.</p>

                  <p>Suppose that we are interested in the biosynthesis of aminocyclopropanes and would like to find structural information on important active site residues in any available aminocyclopropane synthases.

Pressing Enter displays a short list of structures, one of which is 1B8G, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase. Perhaps we would like to know the species from which this protein was derived. Selecting the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Taxonomy</named-content> link to the right shows that this protein was derived from <italic>Malux x domestica</italic>, or the common apple tree. Going back to the Entrez results page and selecting the PDB code (1B8G) opens the Structure Summary page for this record. The species is again displayed on this page, along with a link to the <italic>Journal of Molecular Biology</italic> article describing how the structure was determined. We immediately see from this page that this protein appears as a dimer in the structure, with each chain having three 3D domains, as identified by VAST. In addition, CD-Search has identified an &ldquo;aminotran_1_2&rdquo; CD in each chain. Now we are ready to view the 3D structure.</p>

To view the structure in Cn3D, we simply select the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">View 3D Structure</named-content> button.

                  <p>Upon inspecting the structure, we immediately notice that a small molecule is bound to the protein, likely at the active site of the enzyme. How do we find out what that molecule is? One easy way is to return to the Structure Summary page and select the link to the PDB code, which takes us to the PDB Structure Explorer page for 1B8G. Quickly, we see that pyridoxal-5&prime;-phosphate (PLP) is a HET group, or heterogen, in the structure. Our interest piqued, we would now like to know more about the structural domain containing the active site. Returning to Cn3D, we manipulate the structure so that PLP is easily visible and then use the mouse to double-click on any PLP atom. The molecule becomes selected and turns yellow.

Scanning the Sequence/Alignment Viewer, we see that seven residues are now highlighted: 117-119, 230, 268, 270, and 279. Glancing at the 3D Domain display in the Structure Summary page, we note that all of these residues lie in domain 3. We now focus our attention on this domain.</p>

One powerful way of doing this is to choose structure neighbors from phylogenetically distant organisms. We therefore need to combine our present search with a Taxonomy search. Given that 1B8G is derived from the superkingdom Eukaryota, we would like to find structure neighbors in other superkingdom taxa, such as Eubacteria and Archaea. Returning to the Structure Summary page, select the 3D Domains link in the graphic display to open the list of 3D Domains in Entrez. Finding 1B8GA3 in the list, selecting the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Related 3D Domains</named-content> link shows a list of all the structure neighbors of this domain. From this page, we select <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Preview/Index</named-content>, which shows our recent queries. Suppose our set of related 3D Domains is #5.

                  <title>How to Begin</title>
                  <p>The first step to any structural analysis at NCBI is to find the structure records for the protein of interest or for proteins similar to it. One may search MMDB directly by entering search terms such as PDB code, protein name, author, or journal in the Entrez Structure <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Search</named-content> box on the Structure <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure">homepage</ext-link>. Alternative points of entry are shown below.</p>
                  <p>By using the full array of Entrez search tools, the resulting list of MMDB records can be honed, ideally, to a workable list from which a record can be selected. Users should note that multiple records may exist for a given protein, reflecting different experimental techniques, conditions, and the presence or absence of various ligands or metal ions. Records may also contain different fragments of the full-length molecule. In addition, many structures of mutant proteins are also available. The PDB record for a given structure generally contains some description of the experimental conditions under which the structure was determined, and this file can be accessed by selecting the PDB code link at the top of the Structure Summary page.</p>

                  <p>Cn3D is a software package for displaying 3D structures of proteins. Once it has been <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/CN3D/cn3dinstall.shtml">installed</ext-link> and the Internet browser has been configured correctly, simply selecting the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">View 3D Structure</named-content> button on a Structure Summary page launches the application. Once the structure is loaded, a user can manipulate and annotate it using an array of options as described in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/CN3D/cn3dtut.shtml">Cn3D Tutorial</ext-link>. By default, Cn3D colors the structure according to the secondary structure elements. However, another useful view is to color the protein by domain (see <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Style</named-content> menu options), using the same color scheme as is shown in the graphic display on the Structure Summary page. These color changes also affect the residues displayed in the Sequence/Alignment Viewer, allowing the identification of domain or secondary structure elements in the primary sequence. In addition to Cn3D, users can also display 3D structures with RasMol or Mage. Structures can also be saved locally as an ASN.1, PDB, or Mage file (depending on the choice of structure viewer) for later display.</p>

                  <p>Suppose that we are interested in topoisomerase enzymes and would like to find human topoisomerases that most closely resemble those found in eubacteria and thus may share a common ancestor. Further suppose that through a colleague, we are aware of a recent and particularly interesting crystal structure of a topoisomerase from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> with PDB code 1I7D. How can we identify the conserved functional domains in this protein and then find human proteins with the same domains? From the Structure main page, we enter the PDB code 1I7D in the Structure <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Summary</named-content> search box and quickly find the Structure Summary page for this record. We see that in this crystal structure, the protein is complexed with a single-stranded oligonucleotide. We also see that the protein has five 3D Domains. Two CDs align to the sequence as well, and they overlap with one another at the N-terminus of the protein in the region corresponding to the first 3D domain.</p>

                  <title>Analyzing CDs Found in a Protein</title>
                  <p>The Struture summary page displays only the CDs that give the best match to the protein sequence. To see all of the matching CDs, we can easily perform a full CD-Search. Select the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Protein</named-content> link to the left of the graphic to reveal the flatfile for the record. Then follow the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Domains</named-content> link in the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Link</named-content> menu on the right to view the results of the CD-Search. Select <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Show Details</named-content> to see all CDs matching the query sequence. We find that nine CDs match this sequence, and that the statistics of each match are shown below the alignment graphic. The CD with the best hit is TopA from the COG database, and it is further clear that this domain consists of two smaller domains: TOPRIM (alignments from Pfam, SMART, and curated CD) and a topoisomerase domain (alignments from Pfam and curated CD). We can learn more about these CDs by studying the pairwise alignments at the bottom of the page and by studying their CD Summary pages, reached by selecting the links to their left.</p>

We can execute this taxonomic restriction by selecting <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Go back</named-content>, and we now find a much shorter list of CDART results. In the most similar group, we find two members, one of which is NP_004609. Selecting the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">more&gt;</named-content> link for this record shows the CD-Search results for this human protein.

                  <title>Viewing a CD Alignment with a 3D Structure</title>
                  <p>We now would like to view the alignment of the topoisomerase in the human protein to other members of this CD. On the CD-Search page, select the colored bar of this CD to see a CD-Browser window displaying the alignment. Because this is a curated CD record, we are able to view functional features of the protein domain on a structural template. The rightmost menu in the View Alignment bar shows the available features for this domain, whereas the topmost row in the alignment itself marks the residues involved in this feature with # symbols. The second row of the alignment is the consensus sequence of the CD record, whereas the third row contains the NP_004609 sequence, labeled &ldquo;query&rdquo;. At the bottom of the page, buttons allow Cn3D to be launched with various structural features highlighted. For example, if we are interested in nucleotide binding site II, Cn3D will launch with the view depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.184">Figure 7</xref>, showing the bound nucleotide in orange. Additonal Cn3D windows not shown in Figure 7 allow one to highlight the binding site residues yellow as shown, and these highlights also appear in the sequence window. In this figure, the NP_004609 sequence has been merged into the alignment (bottom row) using tools within Cn3D, and the result shows that this human protein closely conserves these important functional residues.

<title>Summary</title>
<p>The NCBI Taxonomy database is a curated set of names and 
classifications for all of the organisms that are represented 
in GenBank. When new sequences are submitted to GenBank, the 
submission is checked for new organism names, which are then 
classified and added to the Taxonomy database. As of April 
2003, there were 176,890 total taxa represented.</p>
<p>There are two main tools for viewing the information in the 
Taxonomy database: the Taxonomy Browser, and Taxonomy Entrez. 
Both systems allow searching of the Taxonomy database for names, 
and both link to the relevant sequence data. However, the 
Taxonomy Browser provides a hierarchical view of the classification 
(the best display for most casual users interested in exploring 
our classification), whereas Entrez Taxonomy provides a uniform 
indexing, search, and retrieval engine with a common mechanism 
for linking between the Taxonomy and other relevant Entrez 
databases.</p>

<title>History of the Taxonomy Project.</title>
<p>By the time the NCBI was created in 1988, the nucleotide 
sequence databases (GenBank, <abbrev>EMBL</abbrev>, and 
<abbrev>DDBJ</abbrev>) each maintained their own taxonomic 
classifications. All three classifications derived from 
the one developed at the Los Alamos National Lab 
(<abbrev>LANL</abbrev>) but had diverged considerably. 
Furthermore, the protein sequence databases (<xref 
ref-type="other" rid="bid.1412">SWISS-PROT</xref> and 
<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1374">PIR</xref>) each 
developed their own taxonomic classifications that were 
very different from each other and from the nucleotide 
database taxonomies. To add to the mix, in 1990 the NCBI 
and the <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1358">NLM</xref> 
initiated a journal-scanning program to capture and annotate 
sequences reported in the literature that had not been 
submitted to any of the sequence databases. We, of course, 
began to assign our own taxonomic classifications for these 
records.</p>
<p>The Taxonomy Project started in 1991, in association with 
the launch of Entrez (<xref ref-type="other" 
rid="bid.588">Chapter 15</xref>). The goal was to combine 
the many taxonomies that existed at the time into a single 
classification that would span all of the organisms represented 
in any of the GenBank sources databases (<xref ref-type="other" 
rid="bid.2">Chapter 1</xref>).</p>
<p>To represent, manipulate, and store versions of each of 
the different database taxonomies, we wrote a stand-alone, 
tree-structured database manager, TaxMan. This also allowed 
us to merge the taxonomies into a single composite classification. 
The resulting hybrid was, at first, a bigger mess than any of 
the pieces had been, but it gave us a starting point that spanned 
all of the names in all of the sequence databases. For many years, 
we cleaned up and maintained the NCBI Taxonomy database with 
TaxMan.</p>
<p>After the initial unification and clean-up of the taxonomy for 
Entrez was complete, Mitch Sogin organized a workshop to give us 
advice on the clean-up and recommendations for the long-term 
maintenance of the taxonomy. This was held at the NCBI in 1993 
and included: Mitch Sogin (protists), David Hillis (chordates), 
John Taylor (fungi), S.C. Jong (fungi), John Gunderson (protists), 
Russell Chapman (algae), Gary Olsen (bacteria), Michael Donoghue 
(plants), Ward Wheeler (invertebrates), Rodney Honeycutt 
(invertebrates), Jack Holt (bacteria), Eugene Koonin (viruses), 
Andrzej Elzanowski (PIR taxonomy), Lois Blaine (ATCC), and Scott 
Federhen (NCBI). Many of these attendees went on to serve as 
curators for different branches of the classification. In particular, 
David Hillis, John Taylor, and Gary Olsen put in long hours to help 
the project move along.</p>
<p>In 1995, as more demands were made on the Taxonomy database, 
the system was moved to a SyBase relational database 
(<abbrev>TAXON</abbrev>), originally developed by Tim Clark. 
Hierarchical organism indexing was added to the Nucleotide and 
Protein domains of Entrez, and the Taxonomy browser made its 
first appearance on the Web.</p>
<p>In 1997, the <abbrev>EMBL</abbrev> and <abbrev>DDBJ</abbrev> 
databases agreed to adopt the NCBI taxonomy as the standard 
classification for the nucleotide sequence databases. Before that, 
we would see new organism names from the <abbrev>EMBL</abbrev> and 
<abbrev>DDBJ</abbrev> only after their entries were released to 
the public, and any corrections (in spelling, or nomenclature, or 
classification) would have to be made after the fact. We now receive 
taxonomy consults on new names from the <abbrev>EMBL</abbrev> and 
<abbrev>DDBJ</abbrev> before the release of their entries, just as 
we do from our own GenBank indexers. <abbrev>SWISS-PROT</abbrev> 
has also recently (2001) agreed to use our Taxonomy database and 
send us taxonomy consults.</p>
</boxed-text>
<p>Organismal taxonomy is a powerful organizing principle in the 
study of biological systems. Inheritance, homology by common descent, 
and the conservation of sequence and structure in the determination 
of function are all central ideas in biology that are directly related 
to the evolutionary history of any group of organisms. Because of this, 
taxonomy plays an important cross-linking role in many of the 
<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1353">NCBI</xref> tools and databases.</p>
<p>The NCBI Taxonomy database is a curated set of names and classifications 
for all of the organisms that are represented in <xref ref-type="other" 
rid="bid.1299">GenBank</xref>. When new sequences are submitted to GenBank, 
the submission is checked for new organism names, which are then classified 
and added to the taxonomy database. As of April 1, 2003, there were 
4,653 families, 26,427 genera, 130,207 species, and 176,890 total taxa 
represented.</p>
<p>Of the several different ways to build a taxonomy, our group maintains 
a <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/About/primer/phylo.html">phylogenetic 
taxonomy</ext-link>. In a phylogenetic classification scheme, the structure 
of the taxonomic tree approximates the evolutionary relationships among the

<title>A phylogenetic classification scheme.</title>
<p>If two organisms (A and B) are listed more closely together in the taxonomy 
than either is to organism C, the assertion is that C diverged from the 
lineage leading to A+B earlier in evolutionary history, and that A and B 
share a common ancestor that is not in the direct line of evolutionary 
descent to species C. For example, the current consensus it that the closest 
living relatives of the birds are the crocodiles; therefore, our classification 
does not include the familiar taxon Reptilia (turtles, lizards and snakes, 
and crocodiles), which excludes the birds, and would break the phylogenetic 
principle outlined above.</p>

<p>Our classification represents an assimilation of information from many 
different sources (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bid.249">Box 1</xref>). 
Much of the success of the project is attributable to the flood of new 
molecular data that has revolutionized our understanding of the phylogeny 
of many groups, especially of previous poorly understood groups such as 
Bacteria, Archea, and Fungi. Users should be aware that some parts of the 
classification are better developed than others and that the primary 
<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/taxonomyhome.html/
index.cgi?chapter=resources">systematic and phylogenetic literature</ext-link> 
is the most reliable information source.</p>
<p>We do not rely on sequence data alone to build our classification, and 
we do not perform phylogenetic analysis ourselves as part of the taxonomy 
project. Most of the organisms in GenBank are represented by only a 
snippet of sequence; therefore, sequence information alone is not enough 
to build a robust phylogeny. The vast majority of species are not there 
at all, although about 50% of the birds and the mammals are represented. 
We therefore also rely on analyses from morphological studies; the 
challenge of modern systematics is to unify molecular and morphological 
data to elucidate the evolutionary history of life on earth.</p>

<sec id="bid.250">
<title>Adding to the Taxonomy Database</title>
<p>Currently, more than 100 new species are added to the database 
daily, and the rate is accelerating as sequence analysis becomes an 
ever more common component of systematic research and the taxonomic 
description of new species.</p>
<sec id="bid.251">
<title>Sources of New Names</title>
<p>The <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1281">EMBL</xref> and 
<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1272">DDBJ</xref> databases, as well 
as GenBank, now use the NCBI Taxonomy as the standard classification 
for nucleotide sequences (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" 
rid="bid.249">Box 1</xref>). Nearly all of the new species found in 
the Taxonomy database are via sequences submitted to one of these 
databases from species that are not yet represented. In these cases, 
the NCBI taxonomy group is consulted, and any problems with the 
nomenclature and classifications are resolved before the sequence 
entries are released to the public. We also receive consults for 
submissions that are not identified to the species level (e.g., 
&ldquo;Hantavirus&rdquo; or &ldquo;Bacillus sp.&rdquo;) and for 
Anything that looks confusing, incorrect, or incomplete to the 
database indexers. All consults include information on the problem 
Organism names, source features, and publication titles (if any). 
The email addresses for the submitters are also included in case 
we need to contact them about the nomenclature, classification, 
or annotation of their entries.</p>
<p>The number and complexity of organisms in a submission can vary 
enormously. Many contain a single new name, others may include 100 
species, all from the same familiar genus, whereas others may include 
100 names (only half identified at the species level) from 100 genera 
(all of which are new to the Taxonomy database) without any other 
identifying information at all.</p>
<p>Some new organism names are found by software when the protein 
sequence databases (<abbrev>SWISS-PROT</abbrev>, <abbrev>PIR</abbrev>, 
and the <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1380">PRF</xref>) are added to 
Entrez; because most of the entries in the protein databases have been 
derived from entries in the nucleotide database, this is a small number. 
The NCBI structure group may also find new names in the <xref 
ref-type="other" rid="bid.1367">PDB</xref> protein structure database. 
Finally, because we made the Taxonomy database publicly accessible on 
the Web, we have had a steady stream of comments and corrections to our 
spellings and classification from outside users.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.252">
<title>More on Submission</title>
<p>We often receive consults on submissions with explicitly new species 
names that will be published as part of the description of a new species. 
These sequence entries (like any other) may be designated &ldquo;hold 
until published&rdquo; (<abbrev>HUP</abbrev>) and will not be released 
until the corresponding journal article has been published. These species 
names will not appear on any of our taxonomy Web sites until the 
corresponding sequence entries have been released.</p>
<p>Occasionally, the same new genus name is proposed simultaneously 
for different taxa; in one case, two papers with conflicting new names 
had been submitted to the same journal, and both had gone through one 
round of review and revision without detection of the duplication. Although 
these duplications would have been discovered in time, the increasingly 
common practice of including some sequence analysis in the description of 
a new species can lead to earlier detection of these problems. In many 
cases, the new species name proposed in the submitted manuscript is 
changed during the editorial review process, and a different name appears 
in the publication. Submitters are encouraged to inform us when their new 
descriptions have been published, particularly if the proposed names have 
been changed.</p>
<p>We strongly encourage the submission of strain names for cultured 
bacteria, algae, and fungi and for sequences from laboratory animals in 
biochemical and genetic studies; of cultivar names for sequences from 
cultivated plants; and of specimen vouchers (something that definitively 
ties the sequence to its source) for sequences from phylogenetic studies. 
There are many other kinds of useful information that may be contained 
within the sequence submission, but these data are the bare minimum 
necessary to maintain a reliable link between an entry in the sequence 
database and the biological source material.</p>

<title>Using the Taxonomy Browser</title>
<p>The <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" 
ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/
taxonomyhome.html/">Taxonomy Browser</ext-link> (TaxBrowser) provides 
a hierarchical view of the classification from any particular place 
in the taxonomy. This is probably the display of choice for most casual 
users (browsers) of the taxonomy who are interested in exploring our 
classification. The TaxBrowser displays only the subset of taxa from 
the taxonomy database that is linked to public sequence entries. About 
15% of the full Taxonomy database is not displayed on the public Web 
pages because the names are from sequence entries that have not yet been 
released.</p>
<p>TaxBrowser is updated continuously. New species will appear on a daily 
basis as the new names appear in sequence entries indexed during the daily 
release cycle of the Entrez databases. New taxa in the classification 
appear in TaxBrowser on an ongoing basis, as sections of the taxonomy 
already linked to public sequence entries are revised.</p>
<sec id="bid.254">
<title>The Hierarchical Display</title>
<p>The browser produces two different kinds of Web pages: 
<list list-type="arabic">

if they are available in the Taxonomy database. The lineage above 
Hominidae is shown in the <italic>line</italic> at the 
<italic>top</italic> of the display; selecting the word 
<named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Lineage</named-content> 
will toggle back and forth between the abbreviated lineage (the display 
used in GenBank flatfiles) and the full lineage (as it appears in the

Hominidae (in the lineage) or <italic>below</italic> Hominidae (in 
the hierarchical display) will refocus the browser on that taxon

<p>There are two sets of links to Entrez records from the Taxonomy 
Browser. The &ldquo;subtree links&rdquo; are accumulated up the tree 
in a hierarchical fashion; for example, there are 16 million nucleotide 
records and a half million protein records associated with the Chordata 
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.257">Figure 3a</xref>). These are all 
linked into the taxonomy at or below the species leves and can be 
retrieved en masse via the subtree hotlink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Direct links&rdquo; will retrieve Entrez records that are 
linked directly to this particular node in the taxonomy database. Many 
of the Entrez domains (e.g., sequences and structures) are linked into 
the taxonomy at or below the species level; it is a data error when a 
sequence entry is directly linked into the taxonomy at a taxon somewhere 
above the species level. For other Entrez domains (e.g., literature and 
phylogenetic sets), this is not the case. A journal article may talk 
about several different species but may also refer directly to the 
<italic>phylum Chordata</italic>. We have searched the full text of the 
articles in the PubMed Central archive with the scientific names from the 
taxonomy database. Twenty-seven articles in PubMed Central refer directly 
to the <italic>phylum Chordata</italic>; 9,299 articles are linked into the 
taxonomy somewhere in the <italic>Chordata</italic> subtree. The PopSet 
domain contains population studies, phylogenetic sets, and alignments. We 
have recently changed the way that we index phylogenetic sets in Entrez. 
The five &ldquo;Direct links&rdquo; at the <italic>Chordata</italic> 
will retrieve the phylogenetic sets that explicitly span the 
<italic>Chordata</italic>; the &ldquo;Subtree links&rdquo; will also 
include phylogenetic sets that are completely contained within the 
<italic>Chordata</italic>.</p>
<p>The taxon-specific browser pages now also show the NCBI LinkOut links 
to external resources. These include links to a broad range of different 
kinds of resources and are provided for the convenience of our users; the 
NCBI does not vouch for the content of these resources, although we do 
make an effort to ensure that they are of good scientific quality. A

<p>There are several different ways to search for names in the 
Taxonomy database. If the search results in a terminal node in our 
taxonomy, the taxon-specific browser page is displayed; if the search 
returns with an internal (non-terminal) node, the hierarchical 
classification page is displayed.</p>
<!--TONYA, SEE IF DEBBIE AGREES THAT THIS SHOULD BE DEF-LIST.-->
<p><bold>Complete Name.</bold> By default, TaxBrowser looks for the 
complete name when a term is typed into the search box. It looks for 
a case-insensitive, full-length string match to all of the nametypes 
stored in the Taxonomy database. For example, <italic>Homo sapiens, 
Escherichia, Tetrapoda,</italic> and <italic>Embryophyta</italic> would 
all retrieve results.</p>
<p>Names can be duplicated in the Taxonomy database, but the taxonomy 
browser can only be focused on a single taxon at any one time. If a 
complete name search retrieves more than one entry from the taxonomy, 
an intermediate name selection screen appears (<xref ref-type="fig" 
rid="bid.260">Figure 4</xref>). Each duplicated name includes a manually 
curated suffix that differentiates between the duplicated names.

name of the node [as in (<italic>d</italic>)], the primary name is given 
first, followed by the nametype and the duplicated name in <italic>square 
brackets</italic>.</p></caption><graphic 
xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch4f4" 
mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>
<p><bold>Wild Card.</bold> This is a regular expression search, *, with 
wild cards. It is useful when the correct spelling of a scientific name 
is uncertain or to find ambiguous combinations for abbreviated species 
names. For example, <italic>C* elegans</italic> results in a list of 16 
species and subspecies (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bid.262">Box 2</xref>). 
Note: there is still only one <italic>H. sapiens</italic>.</p>
<p><bold>Token Set.</bold> This treats the search string as an unordered set 
of tokens, each of which must be found in one of the names associated with a 
particular node. For example, &ldquo;sapiens&rdquo; retrieves:
<preformat>
Homo sapiens
Homo sapiens neanderthalensis
</preformat>
</p>
<p><bold>Phonetic Name.</bold> This search qualifier can be used when the 
user has exhausted all other search options to find the organism of interest. 
The results using this function can be patchy, however. For example, 
&ldquo;drozofila&rdquo; and &ldquo;kaynohrhabdietees&rdquo; retrieve 
respectable results; however, &ldquo;seenohrabdietees&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;eshereesheeya&rdquo; are not found.</p>

unique identifier (taxid) of the NCBI Taxonomy database, e.g.,

<title>The Taxonomy Database: TAXON</title>
<p>The NCBI Taxonomy database is stored as a SyBase relational database, 
called TAXON. The NCBI taxonomy group maintains the database with a 
customized software tool, the Taxonomy Editor. Each entry in the database 
is a &ldquo;taxon&rdquo;, also referred to as a &ldquo;node&rdquo; in the 
database. The &ldquo;root node&rdquo; (taxid1) is at the top of the 
hierarchy. The path from the root node to any other particular taxon in 
the database is called its &ldquo;lineage&rdquo;; the collection of all 
of the nodes beneath any particular taxon is called its &ldquo;subtree&rdquo;. 
Each node in the database may be associated with several names, of several 
different nametypes. For indexing and retrieval purposes, the nametypes are 
essentially equivalent.</p>
<p>The Taxonomy database is populated with species names that have appeared 
in a sequence record from one of the nucleotide or protein databases. If a 
name has ever appeared in a sequence record at any time (even if it is not 
found in the current version of the record), we try to keep it in the 
Taxonomy database for tracking purposes (as a synonym, a misspelling, or 
other nametype), unless there are good reasons for removing it completely 
(for example, if it might cause a future submission to map to the wrong 
place in the taxonomy).</p>

<title>TAXON Nametypes</title>
<p>There are many possible types of names that can be associated 
with an organism taxid in TAXON. To track and display the names 
correctly, the various names associated with a taxid are tagged 
with a nametype, for example &ldquo;scientific name&rdquo;, 
&ldquo;synonym&rdquo;, or &ldquo;common name&rdquo;. Each taxid 
<bold>must have one</bold> (and only one) scientific name but may 
have zero or many other names (for example, several synonyms, 
several common names, along with only one &ldquo;GenBank common 
name&rdquo;).</p>
<p>When sequences are submitted to GenBank, usually only a scientific 
name is included; most other names are added by NCBI taxonomists at 
the time of submission or later, when further information is discovered. 
For a complete description of each nametype used in TAXON, see 
<xref ref-type="app" rid="bid.301">Appendix 1</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.272">
<title>Classes of TAXON Scientific Names</title>
<p>Scientific names, the only required nametype for a taxid, can be 
further qualified into different classes. Not all &ldquo;scientific 
names&rdquo; that accompany sequence submissions are true Linnaean 
Latin binomial names; if the taxon is not identified to the species 
level, it is not possible to assign a binomial name to it. For 
indexing and retrieval purposes, TAXON needs to know whether the 
scientific name is a Latin binomial name, or otherwise. A full 
listing of the classes of TAXON scientific names can be viewed in

<p>The treatment of duplicated names was discussed briefly in the 
section on the Taxonomy browser. For our purposes, there are four 
main classes of duplicated scientific names: (1) real duplicate names, 
(2) structural duplicates, (3) polyphyletic genera, and (4) other 
duplicate names.</p>
<sec id="bid.274">
<title>Real Duplicate Names</title>
<p>There are several main codes of nomenclature for living organisms: 
the Zoological Code (International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, 
ICZN; for animals), the Botanical Code (International Code of Botanical 
Nomenclature, ICBN; for plants), the Bacteriological Code (International 
Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria, ICNB; for prokaryotes), and the Viral 
Code (International Code of Virus Classification and Nomenclature, ICVCN; 
for viruses). Within each code, names are required to be unique. When 
duplicate names are discovered within a code, one of them is changed 
(generally, the newer duplicate name). However, the codes are complex, 
and not all names are subject to these restrictions. For example, 
<italic>Polyphaga</italic> is both a genus of cockroaches and a suborder 
of beetles, and the damselfly genus <italic>Lestoidea</italic> is listed 
within the superfamily Lestoidea.</p>
<p>There is no real effort to make the scientific names of taxa unique 
among Codes, and among the relatively small set of names represented in 
the NCBI taxonomy database (20,000 genera), there are approximately 200 
duplicate names (or about 1%), mostly at the genus level.</p>
<p>Early in 2002, the first duplicate species name was recorded in the 
Taxonomy database. <italic>Agathis montana</italic> is both a wasp and 
a conifer. In this case, we have used the full species names (with 
authorities) to provide unambiguous scientific names for the sequence 
entries. (The conifer is listed as <italic>Agathis montana</italic> 
de Laub; the wasp, <italic>Agathis montana</italic> Shest).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.1636">
<title>Structural Duplicates</title>
<p>In the Zoological and Bacteriological Codes, the subgenus that 
Includes the type species is required to have the same name as the genus. 
This is a systematic source of duplicate names. For these duplicates, 
we use the associated rank in the unique name, e.g., 
<italic>Drosophila</italic> &lt;genus&gt; and <italic>Drosophila</italic> 
&lt;subgenus&gt;. Duplicated genera/subgenera also occur in the Botanical 
Codes, e.g. <italic>Pinus</italic> &lt;genus&gt; and <italic>Pinus</italic> 
&lt;subgenus&gt;.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.1637">
<title>Polyphyletic Genera</title>
<p>Certain genera, especially among the asexual forms of Ascomycota 
and Basidiomycota, are polyphyletic, i.e., they do not share a common 
ancestor. Pending taxonomic revisions that will transfer species assigned 
to &ldquo;form&rdquo; genera such as <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> to 
more natural genera, we have chosen to duplicate such polyphyletic genera 
in different branches of the Taxonomy database. This will maintain a 
phylogenetic classification and ensure that all species assigned to a 
polyphyletic genus can be retrieved when searching on the genus. Therefore, 
for example, the basidiomycete genus <italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> is 
represented in three different branches of the Basidiomycota: 
<italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> &lt;Sporidiobolaceae&gt;, 
<italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> &lt;Agaricostilbomycetidae&gt;, and 
<italic>Sporobolomyces</italic> &lt;Erythrobasidium clade&gt;.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.1638">
<title>Other Duplicate Names</title>
<p>We list many duplicate names in other nametypes (apart from our 
preferred &ldquo;scientific name&rdquo; for each taxon). Most of these 
are included for retrieval purposes, common names or the names of 
familiar paraphyletic taxa that we have not included in our 
classification, e.g. Osteichthyes, Coelenterata, and reptiles.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.1639">
<title>Other TAXON Data Types</title>
<p>Aside from names, there are several optional types of information 
that may be associated with a taxid. These are (1) rank, such as 
species, genus or family; (2) genetic code, for translating proteins; 
(3) GenBank division; (4) literature citations; and (5) abbreviated 
lineage, for display in GenBank flat files. For more details on these 
data types, see <xref ref-type="app" rid="bid.331">Appendix 3</xref>.</p>

<sec id="bid.1640">
<title>Taxonomy in Entrez: A Quick Tour</title>
<p>The TAXON database is a node within the Entrez integrated retrieval 
system (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.588">Chapter 15</xref>) that 
provides an important organizing principle for other Entrez databases. 
Taxonomy provides an alternative view of <abbrev>TAXON</abbrev> to that 
of TaxBrowser. Entrez adds some very powerful capabilities (for example, 
<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1253">Boolean</xref> queries, search 
history, and both internal and external links) to <abbrev>TAXON</abbrev>, 
but in many ways it is an unnatural way to represent such hierarchical 
data in Taxonomy. (TaxBrowser is the way to view the taxonomy 
hierarchically.)</p>
<p>Taxonomy was the first Entrez database to have an internal 
hierarchical structure. Because Entrez deals with unordered sets 
of objects in a given domain, an alternative way to represent these 
hierarchical relationships in Entrez was required (see the section 
<xref rid="bid.288" ref-type="sec">Hierarchy Fields</xref>, below).</p>
<p>The main focus of the Entrez Taxonomy <ext-link 
xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" 
xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/
query.fcgi?db=Taxonomy">homepage</ext-link> is the search bar but 
also worth noting are the <ext-link 
xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" 
xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/

xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" 
xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/
wwwtax.cgi?mode=Root">TaxBrowser</ext-link> hotlinks that lead to 
Entrez generic help documentation and the Taxonomy browser, respectively.</p>
<p>The default Entrez search is case insensitive and can be for any of 
the names that can be found in the Taxonomy database. Thus, any of the 
following search terms, Homo sapiens, homo sapiens, human, or Man, will 
retrieve the node for <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>.</p>
<p>As for other Entrez databases, Taxonomy supports Boolean searching, 
a <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">History</named-content> 
function, and searches limited by field. The Taxonomy fields can be 
browsed under <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Preview/
Index</named-content>, some are specific to Taxonomy (such as 
<named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Lineage</named-content> 
or <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Rank</named-content>), 
and others are found in all Entrez databases (such as Entrez 
<named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Date</named-content>).</p>
<p>Each search result, listed in document summary (DocSum) format, may 
have several links associated with it. For example, for the search 
result Homo sapiens, the <named-content 
content-type="book-spec-emph">Nucleotide</named-content> link will 
retrieve all the human sequences from the nucleotide databases, 
and the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Genome</named-content> 
link will retrieve the human genome from the Genomes database.</p>

<title>Search Tips and Tricks</title>

<p>A search for Hominidae retrieves a single, hyperlinked entry.

<p><bold>Tax ID List.</bold> Shows only the taxids of the taxa. 
This view can be used to download taxid lists from Entrez.</p>
<p><bold>Info.</bold> Shows a summary of most of the information 
associated with each taxon in the Taxonomy database (similar to the 
TaxBrowser taxon-specific display; <xref ref-type="fig" 
rid="bid.257">Figure 3</xref>). This can be downloaded as a text file; 
an <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1435">XML</xref> representation 
of these data is under development.</p>
<p><bold>Common Tree.</bold> A special display that shows a skeleton 
view of the relationships among the selected set of taxa and is 
described in the section below.</p>
<p><bold>LinkOut.</bold> Displays a list of the linkout links (if any) 
for each of the selected sets of taxa (see <xref ref-type="other" 
rid="bid.650">Chapter 17</xref>).</p>
<p><bold>Entrez Links.</bold> The remaining views follow Entrez 
links from the selected set of taxa to the other Entrez databases 
(Nucleotide, Protein, Genome, etc.) The <named-content

<sec id="bid.282">
<title>The Common Tree Viewer</title>
<p>The Common Tree view shows an abbreviated view of the taxonomic 
hierarchy and is designed to highlight the relationships between a 
selected set of organisms. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.283">Figure 
5</xref> shows the Common Tree view for a familiar set of model 
organisms.
<fig id="bid.283">
<label>5</label>
<caption><title>The Common Tree view for some model organisms.</title>
<p>The ten species shown in <italic>bold</italic> are the ones that 
were selected as input to the Common Tree display. The other taxa 
displayed show the taxonomic relationships between the selected taxa. 
For example, <italic>Eutheria</italic> is included because it is 
the smallest taxonomic group in our classification that includes 
both <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> and <italic>Mus musculus</italic>. 
A &ldquo;+&rdquo; box in the tree indicates that part of the 
taxonomic classification has been suppressed in this abbreviated 
view; selecting the &ldquo;+&rdquo; will fill in the missing lineage 
(and change the &ldquo;+&rdquo; to a &ldquo;-&rdquo;). The 
<named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Expand All</named-content> 
and <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Collapse All</named-content> 
buttons at the <italic>top</italic> of the display will do this globally. 
The <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Search for</named-content> 
box at the <italic>top</italic> of the display can be used to add taxa to 
the Common Tree display; taxa can be removed using the list at the 
<italic>bottom</italic> of the page.</p>

</p>
<p>If there are more than few dozen taxa selected for the common 
tree view, the display becomes visually complex and generally less 
useful. When a large list of taxa is sent to the Common Tree display, 
a summary screen is displayed first. For example, we currently list 
727 families in the Viridiplantae (plants and green algae) 
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.284">Figure 6</xref>).
<fig id="bid.284">
<label>6</label>
<caption>
<title>The Common Tree summary page for the plants and green 
algae.</title>
<p>The taxa are aggregated at the predetermined set of nodes in the 
Taxonomy database that have been assigned &ldquo;BLAST names&rdquo;. 
This serves an informal, very abbreviated, vernacular classification 
that gives a convenient overview. The BLAST names will often not 
provide complete coverage for all species at all levels in the tree. 
Here, not all of our <italic>flowering plants</italic> are flagged 
as <italic>eudicots</italic> or <italic>monocots</italic>. The Common 
Tree summary display recognizes cases such as these and lists the 
remaining taxa as <italic>other flowering plants</italic>. The full 
Common Tree for some or all of the taxa can be seen by selecting the 
check box next to <italic>monocots</italic> on the summary page and 
then <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Choose</named-content>. 
This will display the full Common Tree view for 108 families of 
monocots.</p>

<p>There are several formatting options for saving the common tree

<p>Hyperlinks to a common tree display can be made in two ways: 
<list list-type="arabic">

<title>Indexing Taxonomy in Entrez</title>
<p>As for any Entrez database, the contents are indexed by creating 
term lists for each field of each database record (or taxid). For 
<abbrev>TAXON</abbrev>, the types of fields include name fields, 
hierarchy fields, inherited fields, and generic Entrez fields.</p>
<sec id="bid.287">
<title>Name Fields</title>
<p>There are five different index fields for names in Taxonomy Entrez.</p>
<!--TONYA, SEE IF DEBBIE AGREES THIS IS A DEF-LIST-->
<p><bold>All names</bold>, [name] in an Entrez search &ndash; this 
is the default search field in Taxonomy Entrez. This is different 
from most Entrez databases, where the default search field is the
composite [All Fields].</p>
<p><bold>Scientific name</bold>, [sname] &ndash; using [sname] as a 
qualifier in a search restricts it to the nametype &ldquo;scientific 
name&rdquo;, the single preferred name for each taxon.</p>
<p><bold>Common name</bold>, [cname] &ndash; restricts the search 
to common names.</p>
<p><bold>Synonym</bold>, [synonym] &ndash; restricts the search to 
the &ldquo;synonym&rdquo; nametype.</p>
<p><bold>Taxid</bold>, [uid] &ndash; restricts the search to taxonomy 
IDs, the unique numerical identifiers for taxa in the database. Taxids 
are not indexed in the other Entrez name fields.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.288">
<title>Hierarchy Fields</title>
<boxed-text id="bid.289" position="margin">
<label>3</label>
<title>Examples of combining the subtree and lineage field limits with 
Boolean operators for searching Taxonomy Entrez.</title>
<!--TONYA, TALK TO DEBBIE ABOUT THIS.  I'M NOT SURE WHETHER
THIS SHOULD BE SOME TYPE OF LIST OR NOT-->
<p><bold>(1) Mammalia[subtree] AND Mammalia[lineage]</bold> returns 
the taxon Mammalia.</p>
<p><bold>(2) Mammalia[subtree] OR Mammalia[lineage]</bold> returns 
all of the taxa in a direct parent&ndash;child relationship with the 
taxon Mammalia.</p>
<p><bold>(3) root[subtree] NOT (Mammalia[subtree] OR Mammalia[lineage])</bold> 
returns all of the taxa not in a direct parent&ndash;child relationship 
with the taxon Mammalia.</p>
<p><bold>(4) Sauropsida[subtree] NOT Aves[subtree]</bold> will 
retrieve the members of the classical taxon Reptilia, excluding the 
birds.</p>
</boxed-text>
<p>The [lineage] and [subtree] index fields are a way to superimpose 
the hierarchical relationships represented in the taxonomy on top of 
the Entrez data model. For an example of how to use these field 
limits for searching Taxonomy Entrez, see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" 
rid="bid.289">Box 3</xref>.</p>
<!--TONYA, TALK TO DEBBIE ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS A DEF-LIST-->
<p><bold>Lineage</bold>. For each node, the [lineage] index field 
retrieves all of the taxa listed at or above that node in the taxonomy. 
For example, the query Mammalia[lineage] retrieves 18 taxa from Entrez.</p>
<p><bold>Subtree</bold>. For each node, the [subtree] index field 
retrieves all of the taxa listed at or below that node in the taxonomy. 
For example, the query Mammalia[lineage] retrieves 4,021 taxa from 
Entrez (as of March 9, 2002).</p>
<p><bold>Next level</bold>. Returns all of the direct children of a 
given taxon.</p>
<p><bold>Rank</bold>. Returns all of the taxa of a given Linnaean rank. 
The query Aves[subtree] AND species[rank] retrieves all of the species 
of birds with public sequence entries (there are 2,459, approximately 
half of the currently described species of extant birds).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.290">
<title>Inherited Fields</title>
<p>The genetic code [gc], mitochondrial genetic code [mgc], and GenBank 
division [division] fields are all inherited within the taxonomy. The 
information in these fields refers to the genetic code used by a taxon 
or in which GenBank division it resides. Because whole families or branches 
may use the same code or reside in the same GenBank division, this property 
is usually indexed with a taxon high in the taxonomic tree, and the 
information is inherited by all those taxa below it. If there is no [gc] 
field associated with a taxon in the database, it is assumed that the 
standard genetic code is used. A genetic code may be referred to by either 
name or translation table number. For example, the two equivalent queries, 
standard[gc] and translation table 1[gc], each retrieves the set of 
organisms that use the standard genetic code for translating genomic 
sequences. Likewise, these two queries echinoderm mitochondrial[mgc] and 
translation table 9[mgc] will each retrieve the set of organisms that 
use the echinoderm mitochondrial genetic code for translating their 
mitochondrial sequences.</p>

<sec id="bid.291">
<title>Generic Entrez Fields</title>
<boxed-text id="bid.292" position="margin">
<label>4</label>
<title>The properties [prop] field of Taxonomy in Entrez.</title>
<p>There are several useful terms and phrases indexed in the [prop] 
field. Possible search strategies that specify the prop field are 
explained below.</p>
<!--TONYA, ASK IF THIS SHOULD BE A LIST. "LABELED" PARA'S
WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THESE ARE ITEMS, AND PRESUMABLY THE 
ADDITIONAL PARA'S ARE JUST PART OF THE LIST-ITEM.-->
<p><bold>(1) Using functional nametypes and classifications</bold></p>
<p>unspecified [prop] not identified at the species level</p>
<p>uncultured [prop] environmental sample sequences</p>
<p>unclassified [prop] listed in an &ldquo;unclassified&rdquo; bin</p>
<p>incertae sedis [prop] listed in an &ldquo;incertae sedis&rdquo; bin</p>
<p>We do not explicitly flag names as &ldquo;unspecified&rdquo; in 
<abbrev>TAXON</abbrev>; rather, we rely on heuristics to index names as 
&ldquo;unspecified&rdquo; in the properties field. Many are missed. 
Taxa are indexed as &ldquo;uncultured&rdquo; if they are listed within 
an environmental samples bin or if their scientific names begin with 
the word &ldquo;uncultured&rdquo;.</p>
<p><bold>(2) Using rank level of taxon</bold></p>
<p>All of these search strategies below are valid. Taxonomy 
Eentrez displays only taxa that are linked to public sequence entries, 
and because sequence entries are supposed to correspond to the Taxonomy 
database at or below the species level, the Entrez query: terminal 
[prop] NOT &ldquo;at or below species level&rdquo; [prop] should only 
retrieve problem cases.</p>
<p>above genus level [prop]</p>
<p>above species level [prop]</p>
<p>&ldquo;at or below species level&rdquo; [prop] (needs explicit 
quotes)</p>
<p>below species level [prop]</p>
<p>terminal [prop]</p>
<p>non terminal [prop]</p>
<p>
<bold>(3) Inherited value assignment points</bold></p>
<p>genetic code [prop]</p>
<p>mitochondrial genetic code [prop]</p>
<p>standard [prop] invertebrate mitochondrial [prop]</p>
<p>translation table 5 [prop]</p>
<p>The query &ldquo;genetic code [prop]&rdquo; retrieves all of 
the taxa at which one of the genomic genetic codes is explicitly set. 
The second query retrieves all of the taxa at which one of the 
mitochondrial genetic codes is explicitly set, and so on.</p>
<p>division [prop]</p>
<p>INV [prop]</p>
<p>invertebrates [prop]</p>
<p>The above terms index the assignments of the GenBank division 
codes, which are divided along crude taxonomic categories (see 
<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.2">Chapter 1</xref>). We have placed 
the division flags in the database so as to preserve the original 
assignment of species to GenBank divisions.</p>
</boxed-text>
<p>The remaining index fields are common to most or all Entrez 
domains, although some have special features in the taxonomy domain. 
For example, the field text word, [word], indexes words from the 
Taxonomy Entrez name indexes. Most punctuation is ignored, and the 
index is searched one word at a time; therefore, the search &ldquo;homo 
sapiens[word]&rdquo; will retrieve nothing.</p>
<p>Several useful terms are indexed in the properties field, [prop], 
including functional nametypes and classifications, the rank level of 
a taxon, and inherited values. See <xref ref-type="boxed-text" 
rid="bid.292">Box 4</xref> for a detailed discussion of searches 
using the [prop] field.</p>

<p>Taxids are indexed with the prefix txid: txid9606 [orgn].</p>
<p>Source organism modifiers are indexed in the [properties] field, 
and such queries would be in the form: src strain[prop], src variety[prop], 
or src specimen voucher[prop]. These queries will retrieve all entries with 
a strain qualifier, a variety qualifier, or a specimen_voucher qualifier, 
respectively.</p>
<p>All of the organism source feature modifiers (/clone, /serovar, /variety, 
etc.) are indexed in the text word field, [text word]. For example, one 
could query GenBank for: &ldquo;strain k-12&rdquo; [text word]. Because 
strain information is inconsistent in the sequence databases (as in the 
literature), a better query would be: &ldquo;strain k 12&rdquo;[word] OR 
&ldquo;strain k12&rdquo;[word]. Note: explicit double-quotes may be necessary 
for some of these queries.</p>

<title>Appendix 1. <abbrev>TAXON</abbrev> nametypes.</title>
<sec id="bid.302">
<title>Scientific Name</title>
<p>Every node in the database is required to have exactly one 
&ldquo;scientific name&rdquo;. Wherever possible, this is a 
validly published name with respect to the relevant code of 
nomenclature. Formal names that are subject to a code of 
nomenclature and are associated with a validly published 
description of the taxon will be Latinized uninomials above 
the species level, binomials (e.g. <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>) 
at the species level, and trinomials for the formally described 
infraspecific categories (e.g., <italic>Homo sapiens 
neanderthalensis</italic>). For many of our taxa, it is not 
possible to find an appropriate formal scientific name; these 
nodes are given an informal &ldquo;scientific name&rdquo;. 
The different classes of informal names are discussed in 
<xref ref-type="app" rid="bid.317">Appendix 2</xref>. Functional 
Classes of <abbrev>TAXON</abbrev> Scientific Names.</p>
<p>The scientific name is the one that will be used in all of 
the sequence entries that map to this node in the Taxonomy database. 
Entries that are submitted with any of the other names associated 
with this node will be replaced with this name. When we change 
the scientific name of a node in the Taxonomy database, the 
corresponding entries in the sequence databases will be updated 
to reflect the change. For example, we list <italic>Homo 
neanderthalensis</italic> as a synonym for <italic>Homo sapiens 
neanderthalensis</italic>. Both are in common use in the 
literature. We try to impose consistent usage on the entries 
in the sequence databases, and resolving the nomenclatural 
disputes that inevitably arise between submitters is one of the 
most difficult challenges that we face.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.303">
<title>Synonym</title>
<p>The &ldquo;synonym&rdquo; nametype is applied to both synonyms 
in the formal nomenclatural sense (objective, nomenclatural, 
homotypic <italic>versus</italic> subjective, heterotypic) and 
more loosely to include orthographic variants and a host of names 
that have found their way into the taxonomy database over the years, 
because they were found in sequence entries and later merged into 
the same taxon in the Taxonomy database.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.304">
<title>Acronym</title>
<p>The &ldquo;acronym&rdquo; nametype is used primarily for the 
viruses. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 
(<abbrev>ICTV</abbrev>) maintains an official list of acronyms for 
viral species, but the literature is often full of common variants, 
and it is convenient to list these as well. For example, we list 
HIV, LAV-1, HIV1, and HIV-1 as acronyms for the human immunodeficiency 
virus type 1.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.305">
<title>Anamorph</title>
<p>The term &ldquo;anamorph&rdquo; is reserved for names applied 
to asexual forms of fungi, which present some special nomenclatural 
challenges. Many fungi are known to undergo both sexual and asexual 
reproduction at different points in their life cycle (so-called 
&ldquo;perfect&rdquo; fungi); for many others, however, only the 
asexually reproducing (anamorphic or mitosporic) form is known (in 
some, perhaps many, asexual species, the sexual cycle may have been 
lost altogether). These anamorphs, often with simple and not especially 
diagnostic morphology, were given Linnaean binomial names. A number of 
named anamorphic species have subsequently been found to be associated 
with sexual forms (teleomorphs) with a different name (for example, 
<italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> is the name given to the asexual 
stage of the teleomorphic species <italic>Emericella nidulans</italic>). 
In these cases, the teleomorphic name is given precedence in the 
GenBank Taxonomy database as the &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; name, and 
the anamorphic name is listed as an &ldquo;anamorph&rdquo; nametype.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.306">
<title>Misspelling</title>
<p>The &ldquo;misspelling&rdquo; nametype is for simple misspellings. 
Some of these are included because the misspelling is present in the 
literature, but most of them are there because they were once found in 
a sequence entry (which has since been corrected). We keep them in the 
database for tracking purposes, because copies of the original sequence 
entry can still be retrieved. Misspellings are not listed on the TaxBrowser 
pages nor on the Taxonomy Entrez Info display views, but they are indexed 
in the Entrez search fields (so that searches and Entrez queries with 
the misspelling will find the appropriate node).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.307">
<title>Misnomer</title>
<p>&ldquo;Misnomer&rdquo; is a rarely used nametype. It is used for 
names that might otherwise be listed as &ldquo;misspellings&rdquo; but 
which we want to appear on the browser and Entrez display pages.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.308">
<title>Common Name</title>
<p>The &ldquo;common name&rdquo; nametype is used for vernacular 
names associated with a particular taxon. These may be found at any 
level in the hierarchy; for example, &ldquo;human&rdquo;, 
&ldquo;reptiles&rdquo;, and &ldquo;pale devil's-claw&rdquo; are all 
used. Common names should be in lowercase letters, except where part 
of the name is derived from a proper noun, for example, &ldquo;American 
butterfish&rdquo; and &ldquo;Robert's arboreal rice rat&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The use of common names is inherently variable, regional, and often 
inconsistent. There is generally no authoritative reference that 
regulates the use of common names, and there is often not perfect 
correspondence between common names and formally described scientific 
taxa; therefore, there are some caveats to their use. For scientific 
discourse, there is no substitute for formal scientific names. 
Nevertheless, common names are invaluable for many indexing, retrieval, 
and display purposes. The combination &ldquo;<italic>Oecomys roberti</italic> 
(Robert's arboreal rice rat)&rdquo; conveys much more information 
than either name by itself. Issues raised by the variable, regional, 
and inexact use of common names are partly addressed by the &ldquo;genbank 
common name&rdquo; nametype (below) and the ability to customize names 
in the GenBank flatfile.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.309">
<title><abbrev>BLAST</abbrev> Name</title>
<p>The &ldquo;<abbrev>BLAST</abbrev> names&rdquo; are a specially 
designated set of common names selected from the Taxonomy database. 
These were chosen to provide a pool of familiar names for large 
groups of organisms (such as &ldquo;insects&rdquo;, &ldquo;mammals&rdquo;, 
&ldquo;fungi&rdquo;, and others) so that any particular species (which 
may not have an informative common name of its own) could inherit a 
meaningful collective common name from the Taxonomy database. This was 
originally developed for <abbrev>BLAST</abbrev>, because a list of 
<abbrev>BLAST</abbrev> results will typically include entries from many 
species identified by Latin binomials, which may not be familiar to 
all users. <abbrev>BLAST</abbrev> names may be nested; for example, 
&ldquo;eukaryotes&rdquo;, &ldquo;animals&rdquo;, &ldquo;chordates&rdquo;, 
&ldquo;mammals&rdquo;, and &ldquo;primates&rdquo; are all flagged as 
&ldquo;blast names&rdquo;.</p>
<p><abbrev>BLAST</abbrev> names are now used in several other applications, 
for example the <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1415">Tax BLAST</xref> 
displays, the Summary view in Entrez Taxonomy, and in the Summary 
display of the Common Tree format.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.310">
<title>In-part</title>
<p>The &ldquo;in-part&rdquo; nametype is included for retrieval 
terms that have a broader range of application than the taxon or 
taxa at which they appear. For example, we list reptiles and Reptilia 
as in-part nametypes at our nodes <italic>Testudines</italic> (the 
turtles), <italic>Lepidosauria</italic> (the lizards and snakes), and 
<italic>Crocodylidae</italic> (the crocodilians).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.311">
<title>Includes</title>
<p>The &ldquo;includes&rdquo; nametype is the opposite of the in-part 
nametype and is included for retrieval terms that have a narrower 
scope of application than the taxon at which they appear. For example, 
we could list &ldquo;reptiles&rdquo; as an &ldquo;includes&rdquo; 
nametype for the <italic>Amniota</italic> (or at any higher node in the 
lineage).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.312">
<title>Equivalent Name</title>
<p>The &ldquo;equivalent name&rdquo; nametype is a catch-all category, 
used for names that we would like to associate with a particular node 
in the database (for indexing or tracking purposes) but which do not 
seem to fit well into any of the other existing nametypes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.313">
<title>GenBank Common Name</title>
<p>The &ldquo;genbank common name&rdquo; was introduced to provide a 
mechanism by which, when there is more than one common name associated 
with a particular node in the taxonomy, one of them could be designated 
to be the common name that should be used by default in the GenBank flatfiles 
and other applications that are trying to find a common name to use for 
display (or other) purposes. This is not intended to confer any special 
status or blessing on this particular common name over any of the other 
common names that might be associated with the same node, and we have 
developed mechanisms to override this choice for a common name on a 
case-by-case basis if another name is more appropriate or desirable for 
a particular sequence entry. Each node may have at most one &ldquo;genbank 
common name&rdquo;.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.314">
<title>GenBank Acronym</title>
<p>There may be more than one acronym associated with a particular node 
in the Taxonomy database (particularly if several virus names have been 
synonymized in a single species). Just as with the &ldquo;genbank common 
name&rdquo;, the &ldquo;genbank acronym&rdquo; provides a mechanism to 
designate one of them to be the acronym that should be used for display 
(or other) purposes. Each node may have at most one &ldquo;genbank 
acronym&rdquo;.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.315">
<title>GenBank Synonym</title>
<p>The &ldquo;genbank synonym&rdquo; nametype is intended for those 
special cases in which there is more than one name commonly used in 
the literature for a particular species, and it is informative to have 
both names displayed prominently in the corresponding sequence record. 
Each node may have at most one &ldquo;genbank synonym&rdquo;. For example,
<preformat>
SOURCE Takifugu rubripes (Fugu rubripes)
ORGANISM Takifugu rubripes
</preformat>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.316">
<title>GenBank Anamorph</title>
<p>Although the use of either the anamorph or teleomorph name is 
formally correct under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 
we prefer to give precedence to the telemorphic name as the 
&ldquo;scientific name&rdquo; in the Taxonomy database, both to 
emphasize their commonality and to avoid having two (or more) taxids 
that effectively apply to the same organism. However, in many cases, 
the anamorphic name is much more commonly used in the literature, 
especially when sequences are normally derived from the asexual form 
of the species. In these cases, the &ldquo;genbank anamorph&rdquo; 
nametype can be used to annotate the corresponding sequence records 
with both names. Each node may have at most one &ldquo;genbank 
anamorph&rdquo;. For example:
<preformat>

<title>Appendix 2. Functional classes of <abbrev>TAXON</abbrev> 
scientific names.</title>
<sec id="bid.318">
<title>Formal Names</title>
<p>Whenever possible, formal scientific names are used for taxa. 
There are several codes of nomenclature that regulate the description 
and use of names in different branches of the tree of life. These are: 
the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (<abbrev>ICZN</abbrev>), 
the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (<abbrev>ICBN</abbrev>), 
the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants 
(<abbrev>ICNCP</abbrev>), the International Code of Nomenclature of 
Bacteria (<abbrev>ICNB</abbrev>), and the International Code of Virus 
Classification and Nomenclature (<abbrev>ICVCN</abbrev>).</p>
<p>The viral code is less well developed than the others, but it includes 
an official classification for the viruses as well as a list of approved 
species names. Viral names are not Latin binomials (as required by the 
other codes), although there are some instances (e.g., <italic>Herpesvirus 
papio</italic> or <italic>Herpesvirus sylvilagus</italic>). When possible, 
we try to use <abbrev>ICTV</abbrev>-approved names for viral taxa, but 
new viral species names appear in the literature (and therefore in the 
sequence databases) much faster than they are approved into the 
<abbrev>ICTV</abbrev> lists. We are working to set up taxonomy LinkOut 
links (see <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.650">Chapter 17</xref>) 
to the <abbrev>ICTV</abbrev> database, which will make the subset of 
<abbrev>ICTV</abbrev>-approved names explicit.</p>
<p>The zoological, botanical, and bacteriological codes mandate Latin 
binomials for species names. They do not describe an official 
classification (such as the <abbrev>ICTV</abbrev>), with the exception 
that the binomial species nomenclature itself makes the classification 
to the genus level explicit. If a genus is found to be polyphyletic, 
the classification cannot be corrected without formally renaming at least 
some of the species in the genus. (This is somewhat reminiscent of the 
&ldquo;smart identifier&rdquo; problem in computer science.)</p>
<p>The fungi are subject to the botanical code. The cyanobacteria 
(blue-green algae) have been subject to both the botanical and the 
bacteriological codes, and the issue is still controversial.</p>
<sec id="bid.1641">
<title>Authorities</title>
<p>&ldquo;Authorities&rdquo; appear at the end of the formal species 
name and include at least the name or standard abbreviation of the 
taxonomist who first described that name in the scientific literature. 
Other information may appear in the authority as well, often the year 
of description, and can become quite complicated if the taxon has been 
transferred or amended by other taxonomists over the years. We do not 
use authorities in our taxon names, although many are included in the 
database listed as synonyms. We have made an exception to this rule in 
the case of our first duplicated species name in the database, 
<italic>Agathis montana</italic>, to provide unambiguous names for the 
corresponding sequence entries.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.1642">
<title>Subspecies</title>
<p>All three of the codes of nomenclature for cellular organisms 
provide for names at the subspecies level. The botanical and 
bacteriological codes include the string &ldquo;subsp.&rdquo; in the 
formal name; the zoological code does not, e.g., <italic>Homo sapiens 
neanderthalensis</italic>, <italic>Zea mays subsp. mays</italic>, and 
<italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.321">
<title>Varietas and Forma</title>
<p>The botanical code (but none of the others) provides for two 
additional formal ranks beneath the subspecies level, varietas and 
forma. These names will include the strings &ldquo;var.&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;f.&rdquo;, respectively, e.g., <italic>Marchantia paleacea 
var. diptera, Penicillium aurantiogriseum var. neoechinulatum, Salix 
babylonica f. rokkaku</italic>, or <italic>Fragaria vesca subsp. 
Vesca f. alba</italic></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.1643">
<title>Other Subspecific Names</title>
<p>We list taxa with other subspecific names where it seems useful 
and appropriate and where it is necessary to find places for names 
in the sequence databases. For indexing purposes in the Genomes 
division of Entrez, it is convenient to have strain-level nodes for 
bacterial species with a complete genome sequence, particularly when 
there are two or more complete genome sequences available for 
different strains of the same species, e.g., <italic>Escherichia 
coli</italic> K12, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O157:H7, 
<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O157:H7 EDL933, <italic>Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis</italic> CDC1551, and <italic>Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv.</p>
<p>Several other classes of subspecific groups do not have formal 
standing in the nomenclature but represent well-characterized and 
biologically meaningful groups, e.g., serovar, pathovar, forma 
specialis, and others. In many cases, these may eventually be promoted 
to a species; therefore, it is convenient to represent them 
independently from the outset, e.g., <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic> 
pv. <italic>campestris, Xanthomonas campestris</italic> pv. 
<italic>vesicatoria</italic>, <italic>Pneumocystis carinii</italic> f. sp. 
<italic>hominis, Pneumocystis carinii</italic> f. sp. <italic>mustelae, 
Salmonella enterica</italic> subsp. <italic>enterica</italic> serovar 
Dublin, and <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> subsp. 
<italic>enterica</italic> serovar Panama.</p>
<p>Many other names below the species level have been added to the 
Taxonomy database to accommodate SWISS-PROT entries, where strain 
(and other) information is annotated with the organism name for some 
species.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.323">
<title>Informal Names</title>
<p>In general, we try to avoid unqualified species names such as 
<italic>Bacillus</italic> sp., although many of them exist in the 
Taxonomy database because of earlier sequence entries. 
<italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. is a particularly egregious example, 
because <italic>Bacillus</italic> is a duplicated genus name and 
could refer to either a bacterium or an insect. In our database, 
<italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. is assumed to be a bacterium, but 
<italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. P-4-N, on the other hand, is 
classified with the insects.</p>
<p>When entries are not identified at the species level, multiple 
sequences can be from the same unidentified species. Sequences 
from multiple different unidentified species in the same genus 
are also possible. To keep track of this, we add unique informal 
names to the Taxonomy database, e.g., a meaningful identifier 
from the submitters could be used. This could be a strain name, 
a culture collection accession, a voucher specimen, an isolate 
name or location&mdash;anything that could tie the entry to the 
literature (or even to the lab notebook). If nothing else is 
available, we may construct a unique name using a default formula 
such as the submitter's initials and year of submission. This way, 
if a formal name is ever determined or described for any of these 
organisms, we can synonymize the informal name with the formal 
one in the Taxonomy database, and the corresponding entries in 
the sequence databases will be updated automatically. For example, 
AJ302786 was originally submitted (in November 2000) as 
<italic>Agathis</italic> sp. and was added to the Taxonomy database 
as <italic>Agathis</italic> sp. RDB-2000. In January 2002, this wasp 
was identified as belonging to the species <italic>Agathis montana</italic>, 
and the node was renamed; the informal name <italic>Agathis</italic> 
sp. RDB-2000 was listed as a synonym. A separate member of the genus, 
<italic>Agathis sp.</italic> DMA-1998, is still listed with an informal 
name.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of informal names in the Taxonomy database:
<preformat>
Anabaena sp. PCC 7108
Anabaena sp. M14-2
Calophyllum sp. 'Fay et al. 1997'
Scutellospora sp. Rav1/RBv2/RCv3

</preformat>
</p>
<p>We use single quotes when it seems appropriate to group a phrase 
into a single lexical unit. Some of these names include abbreviations 
with special meanings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;n. sp.&rdquo; indicates that this is a new, undescribed 
species and not simply an unidentified species. &ldquo;sp. nr.&rdquo; 
indicates &ldquo;species near&rdquo;. In the example above, this 
indicates that this is similar to Camponotus gasseri. &ldquo;aff.&rdquo;, 
affinis, related to but not identical to the species given. 
&ldquo;cf.&rdquo;, confer; literally, &ldquo;compare with&rdquo; 
conveys resemblance to a given species but is not necessarily related 
to it. &ldquo;s.l.&rdquo;, sensu lato; literally, &ldquo;in the broad 
sense&rdquo;. &ldquo;ex&rdquo;, &ldquo;from&rdquo; or &ldquo;out of&rdquo; 
the biological host of the specimen.</p>
<p>Note that names with cf., aff., nr., and n. sp. are not unique and 
should have unique identifiers appended to the name.</p>
<p>Cultured bacterial strains and other specimens that have not been 
identified to the genus level are given informal names as well, e.g., 
Desulfurococcaceae str. SRI-465; crenarchaeote OlA-6.</p>
<p>Names such as Camponotus sp. 1 are avoided, because different 
submitters might easily use the same name to refer to different species.

retrieve these names in Taxonomy Entrez.</p>

<sec id="bid.1644">
<title>Uncultured Names</title>
<p>Sequences from environmental samples are given &ldquo;uncultured&rdquo; 
names. In these studies, nucleotide sequences are cloned directly from 
the environment and come from varied sources, such as Antarctic sea ice, 
activated sewer sludge, and dental plaque. Apart from the sequence itself, 
there is no way to identify the source organisms or to recover them for 
further studies. These studies are particularly important in bacterial 
systematics work, which shows that the vast majority of environmental 
bacteria are not closely related to laboratory cultured strains (as 
measured by 16S rRNA sequences). Many of the deepest-branching groups 
in our bacterial classification are defined only by anonymous sequences 
from these environmental samples studies, e.g., candidate division OP5, 
candidate division Termite group 1, candidate subdivision kps59rc, 
phosphorous removal reactor sludge group, and marine archael group 1.</p>
<p>These samples vary widely in length and in quality, from short 
single-read sequences of a few hundred base pairs to high-quality, 
full-length 16S sequences. We now give all of these samples anonymous 
names, which may indicate the phylogenetic affiliation of the sequence, 
as far is it may be determined, e.g., uncultured archaeon, uncultured 
crenarchaeote, uncultured gamma proteobacerium, or uncultured enterobacterium. 
See <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bid.292">Box 4</xref> for how to retrieve 
these names in Taxonomy Entrez.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.325">
<title>Candidatus Names</title>
<p>Some groups of bacteria have never been cultured but can be 
characterized and reliably recovered from the environment by other 
means. These include endosymbiotic bacteria and organisms similar to 
the phytoplasmas, which can be identified by the plant diseases that 
they cause. We do not give these &ldquo;uncultured&rdquo; names, as 
above. These represent a special challenge for bacterial nomenclature, 
because a formal species description requires the designation of a 
cultured type strain. The bacteriological code has a special provision 
for names of this sort, Candidatus, e.g., Candidatus Endobugula or 
Candidatus Endobugula sertula; Candidatus Phlomobacter or Candidatus 
Phlomobacter fragariae. These often appear in the literature without 
the Candidatus prefix; therefore, we list the unqualified names as 
synonyms for retrieval purposes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.326">
<title>Informal Names above the Species Level</title>
<p>We allow informal names for unranked nodes above the species 
level as well. These should all be phylogenetically meaningful 
groups, e.g., the Fungi/Metazoa group, eudicotyledons, 
Erythrobasidium clade, RTA clade, and core jakobids. In addition, 
there are several other classes of nodes and names above the species 
level that explicitly do not represent phylogenetically meaningful 
groups. These are outlined below.</p>
<sec id="bid.327">
<title>Unclassified Bins</title>
<p>We are expected to add new species names to the database in a 
timely manner, preferably within a day or two. If we are able to 
find only a partial classification for a new taxon in the database, 
we place it as deeply as we can and list it in an explicit 
&ldquo;unclassified&rdquo; bin. As more information becomes available, 
these bins are emptied, and we give full classifications to the taxa 
listed there. In general, we suppress the names of the unclassified 
bins themselves so they do not appear in the abbreviated lineages 
that appear in the GenBank flatfiles, e.g., unclassified Salticidae, 
unclassified Bacteria, and unclassified Myxozoa.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.1645">
<title>Incertae Sedis Bins</title>
<p>If the best taxonomic opinion available is that the position of 
a particular taxon is uncertain, then we will list it in an 
&ldquo;incertae sedis&rdquo; bin. This is a more permanent assignment 
than for taxa that are listed in unclassified bins, e.g., 
<italic>Neoptera incertae sedis, Chlorophyceae incertae sedis,</italic> 
and <italic>Riodininae incertae sedis.</italic></p>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.329">
<title>Mitosporic Bins</title>
<p>Fungi that were known only in the asexual (mitosporic, anamorphic) 
state were placed formerly in a separate, highly polyphyletic category 
of &ldquo;imperfect&rdquo; fungi, the Deuteromycota. Spurred especially 
by the development of molecular phylogenetics, current mycological 
practice is to classify anamorphic species as close to their sexual 
relatives as available information will support. Mitosporic categories 
can occur at any rank, e.g., <italic>mitosporic Ascomycota, mitosporic 
Hymenomycetes, mitosporic Hypocreales,</italic> and <italic>mitosporic 
Coniochaetaceae</italic>. The ultimate goal is to fully incorporate 
anamorphs into the natural phylogenetic classification.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.330">
<title>Other Names</title>
<p>The requirement that the Taxonomy database includes names 
from all of the entries in the sequence database introduces a 
number of names that are not typically treated in a taxonomic 
database. These are listed in the top-level group &ldquo;Other&rdquo;. 
Plasmids are typically annotated with their host organism, using 
the /plasmid source organism qualifier. Broad-host-range plasmids 
that are not associated with any single species are listed in their 
own bin. Plasmid and transposon names from very old sequence entries 
are listed in separate bins here as well. Plasmids that have been 
artificially engineered are listed in the &ldquo;vectors&rdquo; bin.</p>

<title>Ranks</title>
<p>We do not require that Linnaean ranks be assigned to all of 
our taxa, but we do include a standard rank table that allows us 
to assign formal ranks where it seems appropriate. We do not require 
that sibling taxa all have the same rank, but we do not allow taxa 
of higher rank to be listed beneath taxa of lower rank. We allow 
unranked nodes to be placed at any point in our classification.</p>
<p>The one rank that we particularly care about is &ldquo;species&rdquo;. 
We try to ensure that all of the sequence entries map into the Taxonomy 
database at or below a species-level node.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.333">
<title>Genetic Codes</title>
<p>The genetic codes and mitochondrial genetic codes that are 
appropriate for translating protein sequences in different branches 
of the tree of life are assigned at nodes in the Taxonomy database 
and inherited by species at the terminal branches of the tree. Plastid 
sequences are all translated with the standard genetic code, but many 
of the mRNAs undergo extensive RNA editing, making it difficult or 
impossible to translate sequences from the plastid genome directly. 
The genetic codes are listed on our <ext-link

<title>GenBank Divisions</title>
<p>GenBank taxonomic division assignments are made in the Taxonomy

<title>References</title>
<p>The Taxonomy database allows us to store comments and references 
at any taxon. These may include hotlinks to abstracts in <xref

external addresses on the Web.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="bid.336">
<title>Abbreviated Lineage</title>
<p>Some branches of our taxonomy are many levels deep, e.g., the 
bony fish (as we moved to a phylogenetic classification) and the 
drosophilids (a model taxon for evolutionary studies). In many cases, 
the classification lines in the GenBank flatfiles became longer than 
the sequences themselves. This became a storage and update issue, and 
the classification lines themselves became less helpful as generally 
familiar taxa names became buried within less recognizable taxa.</p>
<p>To address this problem, the Taxonomy database allows us to flag 
taxa that should (or should not) appear in the abbreviated classification 
line in the GenBank flatfiles. The full lineages are indexed in Entrez 
and displayed in the Taxonomy Browser.</p>

              <title>Summary</title>
              <p>Sequence variations exist at defined positions within genomes and are responsible for individual 

phenotypic characteristics, including a person's propensity toward complex disorders such as heart disease and cancer. As 

tools for understanding human variation and molecular genetics, sequence variations can be used for gene mapping, definition 

of population structure, and performance of functional studies.</p>
              <p>The Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database (dbSNP) is a public-domain archive for a broad collection of 

simple genetic <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1379">polymorphism</xref>s. This collection of polymorphisms includes 

single-base nucleotide substitutions (also known as single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs), small-scale multi-base 

deletions or insertions (also called deletion insertion polymorphisms or DIPs), and retroposable element insertions and 

microsatellite repeat variations (also called short tandem repeats or STRs). Please note that in this chapter, you can 

substitute any class of variation for the term SNP. Each dbSNP entry includes the sequence context of the polymorphism (i.e., 

the surrounding sequence), the occurrence frequency of the polymorphism (by population or individual), and the experimental 

method(s), protocols, and conditions used to assay the variation.</p>
              <p>The dbSNP accepts submissions for variations in any species and from any part of a genome. This document 

will provide you with options for finding SNPs in dbSNP, discuss dbSNP content and organization, and furnish instructions to 

help you create your own (local) copy of dbSNP.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The db<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1405">SNP</xref> has been designed to support submissions 

and research into a broad range of biological problems. These include physical mapping, functional analysis and 

pharmacogenomics, association studies, and evolutionary studies. Because <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/">dbSNP</ext-link> was developed to complement <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1299">GenBank</xref>, it may contain nucleotide sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.1157">Figure 1</xref>) 

from any organism; currently, the majority of the data is for human and mouse.<fig id="bid.1157"><label>1</label><caption><title>The structure of the flanking sequence.</title><p>The structure of the flanking sequence in dbSNP is a composite of bases 

either assayed for variation or included from published sequence. We make the distinction to distinguish regions of sequence 

that have been experimentally surveyed for variation (<italic>assay</italic>) from those regions that have not been surveyed 

(<italic>flank</italic>). The minimum sequence length for a variation definition (SNPassay) is 25 bp for both the 5&prime; and 

3&prime; flanks and 100 bp overall to ensure an adequate sequence for accurate mapping of the variation on reference genome 

sequence. (<italic>a</italic>) Flanking sequence completely surveyed for variation. Both 5&prime; and 3&prime; flanking 

sequence can be defined with 5&prime;_assay and 3&prime;_assay fields, respectively, when all flanking sequence was examined 

for variation. This can occur in both experimental contexts (e.g., denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography or DNA 

sequencing) and computational contexts (e.g., analysis of <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1243">BAC</xref> overlap 

sequence). (<italic>b</italic>) Partial survey of flanking sequence can occur when detection methods examine only a region of 

sequence surrounding the variation that is shorter than either the 25 bp per flank rule or the 100 bp overall length rule. In 

these experimental designs (e.g., chip hybridization, enzymatic cleavage), we designate the experimental sequence 

5&prime;_assay or 3&prime;_assay, and you can insert published sequence (usually from a gene reference sequence) as 

5&prime;_flank or 3&prime;_flank to construct a sequence definition that will satisfy the length rules. (<italic>c</italic>) 

Unknown or no survey of flanking sequence can occur when variations are captured from published literature without an 

indication of survey conditions. In these cases, the entire flanking sequence is defined as 5&prime;_flank and 

3&prime;_flank.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch5f1" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>

                <title>Physical Mapping</title>
                <p>In the physical mapping of nucleotide sequences, variations are used as positional markers. When mapped to 

a unique location in a genome, variation markers work with the same logic as Sequence Tagged Sites 
(<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1410">STS</xref>s) or framework <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1347">microsatellite</xref> 

markers. As is the case for STSs, the position of a variation is defined by its unique flanking sequence, and hence, 

variations can serve as stable landmarks in the genome, even if the variation is fixed for one <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1240">allele</xref> in a sample. When multiple alleles are observed in a sample pedigree, pedigree members can 

be tested for variation <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1302">genotype</xref>s as in traditional physical mapping 

studies.</p>

                <title>Functional Analysis</title>
                <p>Variations that occur in functional regions of genes or in conserved non-coding regions can cause 

significant changes in the complement of transcribed sequences, leading to changes in protein expression that can affect 

aspects of the <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1369">phenotype</xref> such as metabolism or cell signaling. We note 

possible functional implications of DNA sequence variations in dbSNP in terms of how the variation alters mRNA 

transcripts.</p>

                <title>Association Studies</title>
                <p>The associations between variations and complex genetic traits are more ambiguous than simple, single-gene 

mutations that lead to a phenotypic change. When multiple genes are involved in a trait, then the identification of the 

genetic causes of the trait requires the identification of the chromosomal segment combinations, or haplotypes, that carry 

the putative gene variants.</p>

                <title>Evolutionary Studies</title>
                <p>The variations in dbSNP currently represent an uneven but large sampling of genome diversity. The human 

data in dbSNP include submissions from the SNP Consortium, variations mined from genome sequence as part of the human genome 

project, and individual lab contributions of variations in specific genes, mRNAs, <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1283">EST</xref>s, or genomic regions.</p>

content, i.e., content generated during the dbSNP &ldquo;build&rdquo; cycle by computation on original submitted data. 

Computed content consists of refSNPs, other computed data, and links that increase the utility of dbSNP.<fig id="bid.1169"><label>3</label><caption><title>dbSNP submission details for an assay report.</title><p>The major sections of the report are described in the <italic>main panel</italic>.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch5f3" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>

                <title>Flanking Sequence Context DNA or cDNA</title>
                <p>The essential component of a submission to dbSNP is the nucleotide sequence itself. dbSNP accepts 

submissions as either genomic DNA or cDNA (i.e., sequenced mRNA transcript) sequence. Sequence submissions have a minimum 

length requirement to maximize the specificity of the sequence in larger contexts, such as a reference genome sequence. We 

also structure submissions so that the user can distinguish regions of sequence actually surveyed for variation from regions 

of sequence that are cut and pasted from a published reference sequence to satisfy the minimum-length requirements. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.1157">Figure 1</xref> shows the details of flanking sequence structure.</p>

                  <p>Submitters can arbitrarily define variations on either strand of DNA sequence; therefore, 

submissions in a refSNP cluster can be reported on the forward or reverse strand. The orientation of the refSNP and, hence, 

its sequence and allele string, is set by a cluster exemplar. By convention, the clustering process <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.1181">(Figure 6</xref>) picks a cluster exemplar as that member of a cluster with the longest sequence. In subsequent 

builds, this sequence may be in reverse orientation to the current orientation of the refSNP. When this occurs, we try to 

preserve the orientation of the refSNP, if possible, by using the reverse complement of the cluster exemplar to set the 

orientation of the refSNP sequence.<fig id="bid.1181"><label>6</label><caption><title>The dbSNP reclustering process.</title><p>We define clusters on shared locations (refSNPs) when we BLAST all 

existing refSNPs against contig sequence. In cases where contig sequence is not available or the variation is defined in a 

mRNA flanking sequence that will not map to a contig, we compute the refSNP set based on hits to the RefSeq or GenBank 

sequences for the organism. We rank map hits as either LO or HI quality and parse the hits to assign a <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1431">weight</xref> to each refSNP. We make the set of all hits unique by dropping contig location 

and retaining only the first occurrence of each rs#, ss#, ID, and the cluster in which each ID number appears. The resulting 

data include all refSNPs for the current build that have at least one hit to contig, RefSeq, or GenBank sequence. We then 

compare the set of new submissions that fail to hit these sequence sets against each other using BLAST. This removes any 

potential redundancy in the incoming data, and unmapped refSNPs are instantiated for these data as well. This final merged 

set of data constitutes the refSNP set for the current build.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch5f6" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>

                <title>Reclustering</title>
                <p>We define a refSNP operationally as a variation at a location on an ideal reference chromosome. 

Such reference chromosomes are the goal of genome assemblies. However, work is still in progress in cases such as the human 

genome project; therefore, we must currently define a refSNP as a variation in the interim reference contig sequence. Every 

time there is a genomic assembly update, the interim reference contig sequence changes, and refSNPs must be updated or 

reclustered.</p>
                <p>The reclustering process begins when NCBI updates the genomic assembly. We BLAST all existing 

refSNPs as well as any newly submitted SNPs (not yet bound to a refSNP cluster) against the genome assembly. Then, we cluster 

SNPs that co-locate at the same place on the genome into a single refSNP. Usually, new clusters are composed entirely of new 

submitted SNPs, or else the newly submitted SNPs cluster to an already existing refSNP. When newly submitted SNPs cluster 

among themselves, they are assigned to a new refSNP ID#, and when they cluster with an already existing refSNP, they are 

assigned to the cluster for that refSNP.</p>
                <p>Sometimes a refSNP will co-locate with another existing refSNP. In this case, the refSNP with a 

higher ID number is retired, and all the submitted SNPs in its cluster are reassigned to the refSNP with the lower ID 

number.</p>
                <p>Once the clusters are formed, the variation of a refSNP is the union of all possible alleles 

defined in the set of submitted SNPs that composed the cluster. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.1181">Figure 6</xref> is a

mRNA sequence. If the variation is in the coding region of the transcript and has a non-synonymous allele that changes the 

protein sequence, we also annotate the variation on the protein translation of the mRNA. The alleles in protein annotations 

are the amino acid translations of the affected codons.</p>

the variation relative to the structure of the aligned transcript. In other words, a variation may be near a gene

synonymous change, and the other allele will be a nonsynonymous change. If any allele is a nonsynonymous change, then the 

variation is classified as a nonsynonymous variation. Otherwise, the variation is classified as a synonymous variation.</p>

                <p>A schema is a necessary part of constructing your own copy of dbSNP because it is a visual

                <p>Data in dbSNP are organized into &ldquo;zones&rdquo; or boxes, depending on the nature of the 

data. Each zone is color coded to allow the viewer to find the data more easily.

The data dictionary currently includes a description of all the tables in dbSNP, tables of columns and their properties, and 

tables of foreign keys in the conceptual model. Foreign keys are not enforced in the physical model because they make it 

harder to load table data asynchronously. In the future, we will add descriptions of individual columns. The data dictionary 

described above is available in rich text format in the file dbSNPdataDictionary.rtf.gz. The data are also available online

relational database. Each table has either a unique index or a primary key. Foreign keys are not reinforced. There are 

advantages and a disadvantage to this approach. The advantages are: it makes it easy to drop and re-create the table using 

dbSNP_table.atx, which makes it possible to create a partial local copy of dbSNP. For example, if you are interested only in 

the original submitted SNP and their population frequencies and not in their map locations on NCBI genome contigs or GenBank 

Accession numbers (both are huge tables), then these tables can be skipped (i.e., SNPContigLoc and MapLink). Of course, to 

select tables for a particular query, the contents of each table and the dbSNP entity relationship (ER) diagram need to be 

understood. The disadvantage of unreinforced references is that either the stored procedures or the external code needs to be 

written to ensure the referential integrity.</p></list-item>

The FASTA data format is typically used for sequence comparisons using BLAST. BLAST SNP is useful for conducting a few sequence comparisons in the FASTA format, wherease multiple FASTA sequence comparisons will require the construction of a local BLAST database of FASTA formatted data and the installation of a local stand-alone version of BLAST. </p>

              <p>A cycle of flank sequence masking and MegaBLAST alignment to the NCBI genome assembly of an organism is initiated either by the appearance of FASTA-formatted genome sequence for a new build of the assembly or by the significant accrual of newly submitted SNP data for that organism. </p>

                <title>Flank Sequence Masking</title>
                <p>We prepare FASTA-formatted sequence for unclustered ss assays of a particular organism and run RepeatMasker (with the mixed case option set) on the sequence, using the appropriate ALU-repeat library. For human, we use <preformat>repmask -q -xsmall</preformat> and for mouse we use <preformat>repmask -m -q -xsmall</preformat><named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">dust</named-content> is used if no library of repetitive elements is available for the organism. The mixed case sequence is then loaded into the database, replacing the original submitted flank.  The SubSNPRepMask table is updated with repeat masker output that describes the nature and location of the repeat, and a set of mixed-case FASTA is prepared for the entire refSNP set.</p>

              <sec id="bid.2009">
                <title>Organism-specific Genome Mapping</title>
                <p>Both refSNP and subSNP FASTA sets are aligned to the genome assembly using MegaBLAST, and the SNP position is computed from the list of ungapped alignments returned with the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">-D1</named-content> option. We filter the alignments into either a high-threshold category (95 % of SNP flank aligning with fewer than sixth mismatches) or a low-threshold category (75% of the alignment length with fewer than 3% mismatches).  The rest of the MegaBLAST alignments are dropped.  MegaBLAST parameters are set to a default position with the exception of <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">-F m,</named-content> which suppresses seeding hits but allows extension through regions of lowercase sequence.</p>
                <p>We also perform tailored BLAST algorithms to specialized subsets of the database that are known to fail or perform poorly in the standard pathway. Short sequences of 75 bases or fewer are BLASTed with word 
size = 22.  To capture hits in cases where the variation length might break the alignment, each flank of microsatellites or indels are BLASTed independently and paired up in post processing to provide the SNP position. We perform high-stringency BLASTs for many of the heavily masked SNPs using wordsize = 40 and 99% quality in any alignment.  This is an attempt to capture low-multiplicity hits of repetitive sequence without overburdening the BLAST algorithm with a large number of seeded alignments.</p>
                <p>To reduce hit multiplicity in cases where SNPs align several times on the genome, we examine the relative hit quality of multiple hits. Hits are discarded when the mismatch count is greater than the minimum mismatch count. The mismatch count parameter is currently set to 3.  We BLAST refSNPs and subSNPs against GenBank mRNA, RefSeq mRNA, and GenBank clone accessions by a similar procedure.</p>
                <p>We send the output from the genome alignment (or clone alignment where a genome is not available) through a clustering procedure that assigns rs IDs to unclustered new submissions.  In some cases, this clustering procedure will re-cluster existing refSNP clusters based on colocation on the genome. After clustering, we update BLAST output to synchronize the ss IDs and the re-clustered rs IDs to the associated refSNP cluster defined in the database. Location data are loaded into the database, wherease cumulative hit data for each mapped SNP are computed and loaded to the database. Finally, we update SNPFlankStatus.

              <p>The Gene Expression Omnibus (<abbrev>GEO</abbrev>) project was 
	                    initiated at NCBI in 1999 in response to the growing demand for a 
	                    public repository for data generated from high-throughput microarray 
	                    experiments. <abbrev>GEO</abbrev> has a flexible and open design 
	                    that allows the submission, storage, and retrieval of many types 
	                    of data sets, such as those from high-throughput gene expression, 
	                    genomic hybridization, and antibody array experiments. 
	                    <abbrev>GEO</abbrev> was never intended to replace lab-specific 
	                    gene expression databases or laboratory information management 
	                    systems (<abbrev>LIMS</abbrev>), both of which usually cater 
	                    to a particular type of data set and analytical method. Rather, 
	                    <abbrev>GEO</abbrev> complements these resources by acting as

              <title>Site Description</title>
              <p>High-throughput hybridization array- and sequencing-based experiments have become increasingly common in molecular biology laboratories in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.398">1</xref>&ndash;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.401">4</xref>). These techniques are used to measure the molecular abundance of mRNA, genomic DNA, and proteins in absolute or relative terms.  The main attraction of these techniques is their highly parallel nature; large numbers of simultaneous molecular sampling events are performed under very similar conditions. This means that time and resources are saved, and complex biological systems can be represented in a more holistic manner. Furthermore, the development of tissue arrays means that it is possible to analyze, in parallel, the gene expression of large numbers of tumor tissue samples from patients at different stages of cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.402">5</xref>).</p>
              <p>Because of the plethora of measuring techniques for molecular abundance in use, our primary goal in creating the Gene Expression Omnibus (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo">GEO</ext-link>) was to cover the broadest possible spectrum of these techniques and remain flexible and responsive to future trends, rather than choosing only one of these techniques or setting rigid requirements and standards for entry. In taking this approach, however, we recognize that there are obvious, inherent limitations to functionality and analysis that can be provided on such heterogeneous data sets.</p>
              <p>This chapter is both more current and more detailed than the previous literature report on GEO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.403">6</xref>). However, more detailed descriptions, tools, and news releases are available on the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo">GEO Web site</ext-link>.</p>

              <p>The three principle components (or entities) of GEO are modeled after the three organizational units common to high-throughput gene expression and array-based methodologies. These entities are called <italic>platforms</italic>, <italic>samples</italic> and <italic>series</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.340">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="bid.341">Table 1</xref>).  A <italic>platform</italic> is, essentially, a list of probes that defines what set of molecules may be detected in any experiment using that platform. A <italic>sample</italic> describes the set of molecules that are being probed and references a single platform used to generate molecular abundance data. Each sample has one, and only one, parent platform that must be defined previously. A <italic>series</italic> organizes samples into the meaningful data sets that make up an experiment and are bound together by a common attribute.</p>
              <p>The GEO repository is a relational database, which required that some fundamental implementation decisions were made:</p>
              <p>(<italic>a</italic>) GEO does not store raw hybridization-array image data, although &ldquo;reference&rdquo; images of less than 100 Kb may be stored. This decision was based on an assertion that most users of the data within the GEO repository would not be equipped to use raw image data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.404">7</xref>); although some may disagree, this means that repository storage requirements are reduced roughly by a factor of 20.</p>
              <p>(<italic>b</italic>) We decided to use a different storage mechanism for data and metadata. Within the GEO repository, metadata are stored in designated fields within the database table. However, data from the entire set of probe attributes (for each platform) and molecular abundance measurements (for each sample) are stored as a single, text-compressed <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1251">BLOB</xref>. This mode of data storage allows great flexibility in the amount and type of information stored in this BLOB. It allows any number of supplementary attributes or measurements to be provided by the submitter, including optional or submitter-defined information. For example, a microarray (the platform) consisting of several thousand spots (the probes) would have a set of probe attributes, some of which are defined by GEO. The GEO-defined attributes include, for each probe, the position within the array and biological reagent contents of each probe such as a <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1299">GenBank</xref> Accession number, open reading frame (ORF) name, and clone identifier, as well as any number of submitter-defined columns. As another example, the set of probe-target measurements given in the data from a sample may contain the final, relevant abundance value of the probe defined in its platform, as well as any other GEO-defined (e.g., raw signal, background signal) and submitter-defined data.</p>
              <p>Once a platform, sample, or series is defined by a submitter, an Accession number (i.e., a unique, stable identifier) is assigned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.342">Figure 2</xref>). Whether a GEO Accession number refers to a platform, sample, or series can be understood by the Accession number &ldquo;prefix&rdquo;. Platforms have the prefix GPL, samples have the prefix GSM, and series have the prefix GSE.</p>

For deposit: (1) a file containing an ASCII-encoded text table of data can be uploaded, and metadata fields can be interactively entered through a series of Web forms; or (2) both data and metadata for one or more platforms, samples, or series can be uploaded directly in a format we call Simple Omnibus Format in Text, or SOFT (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bid.354">Box 2</xref>).</p>
              <p>Interactive and direct modes of communication are available for new data submissions and updating data submissions. The interactive Web form route is straightforward and most suited for occasional submissions of a relatively small number of samples. Bulk submissions of large data sets may be rapidly incorporated into GEO via direct deposit of SOFT formatted data.</p>
              <p>Submissions may be held private for a maximum of 6 months; this policy allows data release concordant with manuscript publication. Such submissions are given a final Accession number at the time of submission, which may be quoted in a publication.</p>
              <p>Currently, submissions are validated according to a limited set of criteria (see the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo">GEO Web site</ext-link> for more details). Submissions are scanned by our staff to assure that the submissions are organized correctly and include meaningful information. It is entirely up to the submitter to make the data useful to others.</p>
              <p>A quarterly, cumulative graph of the number of individual molecular abundance measurements in public submissions made through the first quarter of 2002 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.355">Figure 4</xref>.</p>

                <title>Entrez ProbeSet indexing and linking process.</title>
                <p>The basic unit (defined by a unique identifier, or UID, in Entrez parlance) in Entrez ProbeSet is the GEO sample, fused with its affiliated platform and series information. The indexing process iterates through all platforms in the GEO database, extracting metadata and the data table and fishing for any sequence-based identifiers such as GenBank Accession, ORFs, Clone IDs, or SAGE tags. Each sample belonging to that platform is in turn assigned a new UID and indexed with the above platform information plus any related series metadata (<xref ref-type="table" rid="bid.358">Table 2</xref>).</p>
                <p>GenBank Accessions, PubMed references, and taxonomy information are also linked to the appropriate Entrez databases for cross-reference and appear in the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Links</named-content> section of the display. Neighbors (related intra-Entrez database links) are generated for UIDs sharing the same GEO platform or series.</p>
              </boxed-text>
              <p>Extensive indexing and linking on the data in GEO are performed periodically and can be queried through Entrez ProbeSet (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bid.357">Box 3</xref>). Many users of Entrez will recognize this interface as similar to that of other popular NCBI resources such as <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1387">PubMed</xref> and GenBank. As with any Entrez database, a <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1253">Boolean</xref> phrase may be entered and restricted to any number of supported attribute fields (<xref ref-type="table" rid="bid.358">Table 2</xref>). Matches are linked to the full GEO entry as well as to other Entrez databases, currently Nucleotide, Taxonomy, and PubMed, as well as related Entrez ProbeSet entries. (See <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.588">Chapter 15</xref> for more details.) Entrez ProbeSet is accessible through the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=geo">Entrez Web site</ext-link> as one of the drop-down menu selections.</p>

              <title>Example of Retrieving Data</title>
              <p>Because samples are oftentimes organized into meaningful data sets within series, an example of retrieving a series and all the data of its associated samples and platform(s) is illustrative of the retrieval capabilities of the GEO Web site. For this example, to select a series of interest, we scan down a list of series in the GEO repository. However, to arrive at our series of interest, we could have just as well performed an Entrez ProbeSet query and followed GEO accession links to a sample and then to its related series, or followed links from PubMed to Entrez ProbeSet, and then to GEO. A step-by-step example of selecting a series of data and retrieving the data for this series from the GEO repository follows:

              <p>The GEO resource is under constant development and aims to improve its indexing, linking, searching, and display capabilities to allow vigorous data mining. Because the data sets stored within GEO are from heterogeneous techniques and sources, they are not necessarily comparable. For this reason, we have defined a ProbeSet to be a collection of GEO samples that contains comparable data. The selection of GEO samples into ProbeSets is necessary before integrating data in the GEO repository into other NCBI resources (see <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.588">Chapter 15</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.610">Chapter 16</xref>, and <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1562">Chapter 20</xref>), as well as for developing useful display tools for these data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.366">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

                  <p>Currently, there are three ways to retrieve submissions. One way is by entering a valid GEO Accession number into the query box on the header bar of this page; this will take you to the Accession Display. Another is to use the platform, sample, and series lists, located on the GEO Statistics page. Sophisticated queries of GEO data and linking to other Entrez databases can be accomplished by using Entrez ProbeSet.</p>

It is the continuously updated electronic version of <italic>Mendelian 
Inheritance in Man</italic> (MIM). MIM was last published in 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.1651">1</xref>) and is authored and edited by Dr. Victor A. McKusick and a team of science writers, editors, scientists, and physicians at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jhu.edu">The Johns Hopkins University</ext-link> and 
around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.1652">2</xref>). 
Curation of the database and editorial decisions take place at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
OMIM provides authoritative free text overviews of genetic disorders and gene loci that can be used by clinicians, researchers, students, and educators. In addition, OMIM has many rich connections to relevant primary data resources such as bibliographic, sequence, and map information.</p>

                      <p>MIM numbers are frequently preceded by a symbol. 
An asterisk (*) before a MIM number indicates that the entry describes a distinct gene or phenotype and that the mode of inheritance of the
phenotype has been proved (in the judgment of the authors and editors)
and that the phenotype described is not known to be determined by a 
gene represented by other asterisked entries in MIM. </p>
                      <p>A number sign (#) before a MIM 
number describing a phenotype indicates that the phenotype is caused by mutation in a gene represented by another entry and usually in any of two or more genes represented by other entries.  The number sign is also used for phenotypes that result from specific chromosomal aberrations, such as Down syndrome, and for contiguous gene syndromes, such as Langer-Giedion syndrome.  Whenever a number sign is used, the reason is stated at the outset of the entry.</p>
                      <p>The absence of an asterisk (or other
sign) preceding the number indicates that the distinctness of the
phenotype as a mendelizing entity or the characterization of the gene in the human is not established.</p>

experts in the field and by the OMIM staff, based on information in 
the published literature. All entries are assigned a unique, stable, 
six-digit ID number and provide names and symbols used for the disorder and/or gene, a literature-based description, citations, contributor information, and creation and editing dates.
Because MIM is derived from the primary literature, the text is replete with citations and links to PubMed. OMIM authors create entries for each unique gene or Mendelian disorder for which sufficient information exists and do not wittingly create more
than one entry for each gene <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1332">locus</xref>.</p>
                <p>MIM is organized into autosomal, X-linked,
Y-linked, and mitochondrial catalogs, and MIM numbers are assigned
sequentially within each catalog (<xref ref-type="table" rid="bid.409">Table 1</xref>).  The kinds of information that may be included in MIM entries are approved name and symbol (obtained from the HUGO Nomenclature Committee), alternative names and symbols in common use, and a text description of the disease or gene.
Many of the longest entries and most new entries in MIM have headings
within the text that may include Clinical Features,
Inheritance, Population Genetics, Heterogeneity, Genotype/Phenotype
Correlations, Cloning, Gene Structure, Gene Function, Mapping, and more. Information on selected disease-causing mutations is contained in the Allelic Variant section of the entry describing the gene.</p>
                <p>With the increasing complexity of 
biological information, OMIM makes a critical contribution by 
distilling what is known about a gene or disease into a single, 
searchable entry. The rich text of the OMIM entry, along with the 
source reference citations, make it easy to retrieve data of 
interest.  The OMIM entry can then serve as a gateway to other sources
of related information via the many curated and computed links within
each entry.</p>

                <p>OMIM can be found either by direct query 
via <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=OMIM">Entrez</ext-link>, from other data resources within NCBI that connect to OMIM directly (for example, LocusLink or UniGene), or through Entrez cross-indexing (for example, from a <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1387">PubMed</xref> abstract of an article cited in an OMIM 
entry). OMIM is indexed for retrieval in Entrez using a weighted 
system so that if the query term(s) appears in the title of a MIM entry, it will appear at the top of the retrieval list.  
<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/Omim/omimhelp.html#SearchFields">Field restrictions</ext-link> are supported for some types of information, or one can use the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Limits</named-content> page to restrict a search (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.412">Figure 1</xref>).  There are also several format options for viewing a retrieval set that may affect which entries are displayed (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bid.415">Box 1</xref>).<fig id="bid.412"><label>1</label><caption><title>The <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Limits</named-content>

for the rest of Entrez.</p>
                <p>The Gene Map can be accessed from an 
individual OMIM entry via the cytogenetic location displayed when
appropriate under the entry titles. The Gene Map may also be queried <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/htbin-post/Omim/getmap">directly</ext-link>.

query bar. The mechanics of selecting entries to display, how to 
display them, and identifying related entries either within Entrez or 
from external resources is also according to the Entrez/LinkOut 
standard. The display options (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bid.415">Box

                <p>When viewing the text of an OMIM entry, 
however, the navigational links serve as an electronic table of 
contents. The section headings within the entry are listed similar to a table of contents, and selecting one moves the display to that section. Within an entry, selecting the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">MIM #</named-content> link takes you back to the top of the entry.</p>
                <p>OMIM staff actively contributes to the 
curation of data in LocusLink. Thus, if the MIM number is represented in LocusLink, a reciprocal LocusLink link is provided in the section to the left. Other links provided by the LocusLink collaboration may also be listed in this section, e.g., links to Nomenclature, Reference Sequences, or UniGene clusters that are specific to the subject OMIM entry.</p>
                <p>The sequence links in the LocusLink 
section may be different from the Entrez indexing links available via
the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Links</named-content> link at the top right of an entry. The Entrez 
indexing links result indirectly from the references in the OMIM entry and may include related sequences in other species, for example. 
Thus, OMIM pages allow two levels of sequence connection: the specific ones in the left section under LocusLink and the indirect but still informative ones through Entrez indexing link at the upper right. More information on OMIM link types can be found in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/Omim/omimhelp.html#LinkTypesOverview">Help</ext-link> documents.</p>
                <p>OMIM entries may also contain a link to 
LinkOut for resources external to NCBI (see <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.650">Chapter 17</xref>). Some of these external resouces are 
curated by OMIM staff, in which case they are displayed by name. 
Others can be seen either by selecting <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">LinkOut</named-content> in the

                <title>The OMIM Entry</title>
                <p>Each OMIM entry has a unique number and is
given a primary title and symbol. This is the title that is displayed
in the document retrieval list. Alternative designations are listed
below the primary title. Some entries contain information that is 
related but not synonymous to the primary topic and is not addressed in another entry (e.g., splice variants, phenotypic variants, etc.).  
This information is set off by the word &ldquo;included&rdquo; in the 
title. The first &ldquo;included&rdquo; title is displayed in the 
document retrieval list. The cytogenetic map location when known is given for each entry. When a disease shows genetic heterogeneity, more than one map location may be given. The &ldquo;light bulb&rdquo; icon at the end of text paragraphs links to related articles in PubMed. References within the text are linked to the complete citation at the end of the entry. There, the PubMed ID is linked to the PubMed abstract.</p>
                <p>Some entries contain an <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Allelic 
Variants</named-content> section, which lists noteworthy mutations for the gene. 
Allelic variants are given a 10 digit number: the 6-digit number of the parent locus, followed by a decimal point and a unique 4-digit variant number. Criteria for inclusion include the first mutation to be discovered, high population frequency, distinctive phenotype, historic significance, unusual mechanism of mutation, unusual pathogenetic mechanism, and distinctive inheritance (e.g., dominant with some mutations, recessive with other mutations in the same gene).  Most of the allelic variants represent disease-producing mutations. A few polymorphisms are included, many of which show a statistically significant association with specific common disorders.</p>

              <p>The <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=Books">BookShelf</ext-link> is a collection of biomedical books that can be searched directly in Entrez or found via keyword links in PubMed abstracts. Books have been added to the BookShelf in collaboration with authors and publishers, and the complete content (including all figures and tables) is free to use for anyone with an Internet connection.</p>
              <p>The online books are displayed one section at a time, with navigation provided to other parts of the current chapter or to other chapters within the book. Many of the books on the BookShelf can be browsed without any restriction at all; others have less flexibility for navigating the complete content. The publisher (or the owner of the content) defines the rules for access.</p>
              <p>The books are linked to PubMed through research papers citations within the text. In the future, more links may be established between the BookShelf and other resources at NCBI, such as gene and protein sequences, genomes, and macromolecular structures.</p>

                <title>Basis for Inclusion</title>
                <p>The BookShelf provides a venue through which publishers and authors can make the full text of biomedical books available to the scientific community. As the BookShelf grows, we welcome proposals from authors, editors, or publishers of any &ldquo;in-scope&rdquo; texts, from undergraduate textbooks to more specialized publications, including collections of review articles or workshop proceedings. The scope of the BookShelf is broadly biomedical, including clinical works and those concerning basic biological and chemical sciences.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="bid.426">
                <title>Information for Authors, Editors, and Publishers</title>
                <p>All books made available on the BookShelf have been provided in electronic format to <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1353">NCBI</xref>. The publisher must provide the content <italic>in full</italic>. Because the complete content is required for display and indexing purposes, the authors, editors, and publisher of a book should all be a part of the decision to participate in the BookShelf. Interested parties can contact us at <email>books@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</email> for more information or to make a proposal for the inclusion of a book. There is a simple contract that specifies the terms of use of the content. A sample contract can also be obtained by request at the above email address.</p>
                <p>The complete contents of each book will be converted into <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1435">XML</xref> according to the NCBI Book Document Type Definition (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1277">DTD</xref>), a public domain DTD developed at NCBI for this project (see below). Books may be submitted to conform to this DTD, or NCBI will convert the source data to validate against the Book DTD. If a conversion needs to be done, the content must be in a format robust enough to meet the needs of the BookShelf publishing system and DTD.</p>
                <p>Any book that was printed from <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1400">SGML</xref> or XML should allow for a straightforward conversion. We have had success converting books from Word, XYWrite, PDF, and Quark Express formats, and we anticipate that we would also be able to convert from other desktop publishing packages. <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1312">HTML</xref> and PDF formats are less desirable because the data formats are less detailed.</p>
                <p>Figures should be supplied in TIFF format, although GIF and JPEG formats may be accepted. The submitted text files are converted into XML according to the NCBI Book DTD; graphic files are converted into GIF and JPEG formats. Three hard copies of the book are also required, along with the electronic files.</p>
                <p>The XML files are stored in a database. When a reader requests a book, chapter, or section, the XML is retrieved from the database and converted into HTML on the fly using Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/">XSLT</ext-link>) and Cascading Style Sheets (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS</ext-link>).</p>

              <title>How to Use the Books</title>
              <p>There are three ways to access the content in BookShelf:</p>
              <p>1. Through hyperlinked terms in PubMed abstracts</p>
              <p>2. By a direct search using search terms or phrases (in the same way as the bibliographic database of PubMed is searched)</p>
              <p>3. Through the Table of Contents of the book (note: some publishers restrict browsing through the entire book by disabling hyperlinks in the Table of Contents)</p>
              <sec id="bid.428">
                <title>Links from PubMed</title>
                <p>The BookShelf can be accessed from all PubMed abstract pages. When viewing a full PubMed abstract, select the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Books</named-content> hyperlink in the upper right-hand corner. This generates a version of the abstract in which certain phrases and terms appear as hypertext links (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.429">Figure 1</xref>). The linked term may be one or more words in length. If a word or a phrase is linked, it means that the exact phrase also appears in at least one book. Selecting a linked phrase retrieves a list of books that contain that term.<fig id="bid.429"><label>1</label><caption><title>A PubMed abstract showing terms linked to books.</title><p>This view was generated by selecting <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Links</named-content> found in the <italic>top right corner</italic> of the abstract and then selecting <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Books</named-content> from the drop-down menu that appears.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch8f1" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>
                <p>A statistical weighting system based on the frequency of each phrase in a book section, relative to the rest of the book, is used to identify &ldquo;good&rdquo; phrases. A phrase that appears repeatedly in only a few sections and rarely in other parts of the book indicates a definitive phrase for those few sections; therefore, it ranks highly. Furthermore, the appearance of a phrase in the title, for example, has a greater value in the weighting system than one appearing solely in the text.</p>
                <p>Each PubMed abstract can thus be linked to the appropriate book pages. This method allows two very dissimilar types of text&mdash;the dense, focused PubMed abstracts and the more descriptive book text&mdash;to find common ground.</p>

                <p>Results are shown as a list of books in which the term is found, along with the number of sections, figures, and tables that contain the term (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.433">Figure 2</xref>). The book that contains the most hits appears at the top of the list. Choosing the hyperlinked number of items that is associated with a particular book will then display a document summary list of the individual sections, figures, and tables found. (When a term or phrase is found fewer than 20 times within the BookShelf, the document summary page is shown directly, without first displaying the results clustered by book.)<fig id="bid.433"><label>2</label><caption><title>A results page from a BookShelf search.</title><p>If more than 20 sections, tables, and/or figures are found that contain the query term, a summary page, such as the one above, is displayed.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch8f2" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>
                <p>The document summary list is sorted with the most relevant documents shown at the top of the page. The sorting makes use of scores allocated to phrases as a measure of how relevant they are to a given section (a part of the statistical weighting system also used for linking PubMed abstracts to the books). For each book section found, the title, along with some context regarding the hierarchy of the section location (e.g., the chapter and book), is given. An icon is used to distinguish figure legends and tables from text sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.434">Figure 3</xref>). Selecting a hyperlinked section title displays the part of the book that contains the search term. From this point, the user may be able to navigate further throughout the book content, according to the policy of the publisher (see <italic>Navigating Book Content</italic>).<fig id="bid.434"><label>3</label><caption><title>A document summary list of book sections.</title><p>The most relevant sections to the query appear at the top of the list.

                <p>Each HTML page of content seen in a Web browser represents one section of one chapter of a book, i.e., all of the content (including subsections and so on) within the first-level heading of a chapter. The amount of content this represents varies according to the structure of the original book. Some books have very long sections, some short, some a mixture; although on the whole, most chapters are divided into 3-10 sections.</p>
                <p>The top of every page contains links to both short and detailed Tables of Contents and a description of the current location within the book (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.436">Figure 4</xref>). The hierarchal elements that describe the current location are hyperlinked and may be used to travel up the organizational levels of a book. Additionally, a navigation sidebar shows the current section among its peers and lists the figures and tables found within the current section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.436">Figure 4</xref>). Reference citations in the text are linked where possible to PubMed abstracts by the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/citmatch.html">Citation Matcher</ext-link>. References internal to the book, e.g., to other chapters or sections, figures, tables, and boxes, are also hyperlinked. Further navigation from the current page to other parts of the book depends on the access policy of the publisher.<fig id="bid.436"><label>4</label><caption><title>Navigation elements that appear on every book HTML page.</title><p>Hyperlinks to various sections within a chapter appear within a navagation bar to the <italic>left</italic> of each page.

                <p>All book content submitted to the BookShelf is converted to XML according to the public NCBI Book DTD.</p>
                <p>Any files submitted in SGML or XML are converted to the Book DTD using <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1437">XSLT</xref>. Books submitted in desktop publishing or word processing formats are converted by a contractor using proprietary technologies. Once the book XML is valid against the DTD, the book is ready to be loaded into the database.</p>
                <p>The XML for a book is generally a set of files. Each chapter and appendix is an independent file, as is the frontmatter. The book is pulled together by the book.xml file, which defines the structure of the book. For example, a book with two chapters and a bibliography at the end of the book would be structured as follows:
                  <preformat>
&lt;!DOCTYPE book SYSTEM "ncbi-book.dtd" [
&lt;!-- graphics -->
&lt;!ENTITY % Graphics SYSTEM "graphics.xml">

&lt;/body>
&lt;back>
&amp;biblist;
&lt;/back>
&lt;/book></preformat>
                </p>
                <p>The book.xml file is composed of two parts. The first part defines all of the components that are required to build the book. These definitions occur within the &lt;!DOCTYPE [ ] &gt; tag. The second part builds the structure of the book. The root element is &lt;book&gt;. &lt;book&gt; contains whatever is in &amp;frontmatter;, &lt;body&gt;, and &lt;back&gt;.</p>
                <p>The book.xml example above refers to five external files: fm.xml, which contains all of the frontmatter of the book; ch1.xml, which contains chapter 1; ch2.xml, which contains chapter 2; biblist.xml, which contains the bibliography for the book; and graphics.xml, which defines the images. If any of these files is not valid according to the DTD or if the files are not found where they are defined in their &lt;!ENTITY &gt; declaration, then the book will not be valid.</p>

                <p>The BookShelf uses the same character sets that PubMed Central uses (see <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.457">Chapter 9</xref>). These include a number of standard <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1326">ISO</xref> character sets (8879 and 9573), along with a set of characters that has been defined to accommodate characters not in the standard set. The ISO Standard Character sets referenced are listed in Box 1 of <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.457">Chapter 9</xref>. Special characters are converted to the BookShelf/PubMed Central (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1375">PMC</xref>) character set during conversion into XML. Characters created for one book (book-specific characters) are called out in the XML as images. To provide for the most flexibility in displaying characters across platforms, BookShelf uses <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1428">UTF-8</xref> encoding whenever possible. Because not all browsers support the same subset of UTF-8 characters and some characters cannot be represented in UTF-8, the BookShelf displays characters as a combination of GIFs and UTF-8 characters, depending on the Browser/OS combination and the character to be displayed.</p>

              <title>The BookShelf Data Flow</title>
              <p>The XML files for each book are stored in a <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1413">Sybase</xref> database. To show the best representation to each reader, the reader's browser and operating system are noted and passed to the rendering software. When a reader requests a book, chapter, or section, the XML and the character images or UTF-8 characters appropriate to the reader's system are retrieved from the database.</p>
              <p>The XML is converted to HTML using XSLT stylesheets. The look of the HTML pages is controlled further using CSS, which allow manipulation of colors, fonts, and typefaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.443">Figure 5</xref>).<fig id="bid.443"><label>5</label><caption><title>Processing and data flow of books.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch8f5" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>
              <p>The Table of Contents for a book is created from actual elements within the book content, rather than from the Table of Contents given in the book frontmatter of the hard copy. This ensures that the Table of Contents represents the content accurately as it is organized on BookShelf.</p>

                <p>In the first version of the NCBI BookShelf project, Quark files were converted directly to HTML for display online. The result was effective, illustrating the value of having a textbook online and linked to PubMed; however, it was labor intensive, limiting, and not scaleable.</p>
                <p>To simplify the delivery of books online and to allow for the expansion of linking within the Entrez system, NCBI decided to convert all content into a centralized XML format. The normalized XML content is easier to render, allows added value such as the addition of links to other NCBI databases, and simplifies the addition of new volumes.</p>
                <p>PMC created a new DTD for the BookShelf project, which was based on the ISO-12803 DTD. As more books were converted to the NCBI Book DTD, changes had to be made to accommodate the data.</p>
                <p>The NCBI Book DTD is a public DTD available on request from <email>books@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</email>.</p>

              <title>Summary</title>
              <p>PubMed Central (PMC) is the National Library of Medicine's digital archive of full-text journal literature. Journals deposit material in PMC on a voluntary basis. Articles in PMC may be retrieved either by browsing a table of contents for a specific journal or by searching the database. Certain journals allow the full text of their articles to be viewed directly in PMC. These are always free, although there may be a time lag of a few weeks to a year or more between publication of a journal issue and when it is available in PMC. Other journals require that PMC direct users to the journal's own Web site to see the full text of an article. In this case, the material will always be available free to any user no more than 1 year after publication but will usually be available only to the journal's subscribers for the first 6 months to 1 year.</p>
              <p>To increase the functionality of the database, a variety of links are added to the articles in PMC: between an article correction and the original article; from an article to other articles in PMC that cite it; from a citation in the references section to the corresponding abstract in PubMed and to its full text in PMC; and from an article to related records in other Entrez databases such as Reference Sequences, OMIM, and Books.</p>

              <title>A PubMed Central (PMC) Site Guide</title>
              <p>The <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pubmedcentral.gov/">PMC homepage</ext-link> has a list of all journals available in PMC and the earliest available issue for each journal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.459">Figure 1</xref>). From here, a table of contents for the latest available issue of a journal or a list of all issues of the journal available through PMC can be viewed.<fig id="bid.459"><label>1</label><caption><title>The PMC journal list.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch9f1" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>
              <p>Every article citation in a table of contents includes one or more links (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.460">Figure 2</xref>). Articles for which the full text is available directly in PMC generally have links to an Abstract view, a Full Text view, and a PDF (printable view). Where applicable, they also have links to Corrections and to supplementary data that may be available for the article. In cases where the full text is available only at the journal publisher's site, there is only one link, to a PubLink page (described below).<fig id="bid.460"><label>2</label><caption><title>PMC table of contents.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch9f2" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>
              <p>In addition to the header information for the article itself, the upper part of a Full Text or PubLink page contains a variety of links, including links to other forms of the article, to related information in PubMed and other <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1282">Entrez</xref> databases, and to corrections or &ldquo;cited-in&rdquo; lists where these apply (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.461">Figure 3</xref>). The sidebar in the body of a Full Text page (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.462">Figure 4</xref>) has links to tables and thumbnail images of any figures in the article, which when selected will display the full figure. Figures and tables may also be opened directly from the point in the text where they are referenced. Citations in the References section of an article frequently include a link to the corresponding PubMed abstract and sometimes also have a link to the full text of the referenced article in PMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.463">Figure 5</xref>).<fig id="bid.461"><label>3</label><caption><title>Header of Abstract and Full Text pages.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch9f3" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig><fig id="bid.462"><label>4</label><caption><title>Body of Full Text page.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch9f4" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig><fig id="bid.463"><label>5</label><caption><title>References.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch9f5" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>
              <p>An Abstract page is identical to a Full Text page that has been cut off at the end of the abstract.</p>
              <p>A PMC PubLink page (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.464">Figure 6</xref>) is similar to an Abstract page, except that it does not have links to alternate forms (Full Text or PDF) of the article in PMC. Instead, it contains a link to the full text at the publisher's site and information about when it will be freely available.<fig id="bid.464"><label>6</label><caption><title>PubLink page.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch9f6" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>
              <p>When an article has been cited by other articles in PMC, a &ldquo;cited-in&rdquo; link displays just under the article header information on both the Abstract and Full Text pages. Selecting this cited-in link gives you a list of the articles that have referenced the subject article (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.465">Figure 7</xref>).<fig id="bid.465"><label>7</label><caption><title>Cited-in list.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch9f7" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>
              <p>PMC article citations may also be retrieved by doing a search in PMC or through a PubMed search. (In PubMed, use the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">subsets</named-content> limit if you want to find only articles that are available in PMC.)</p>

            <sec id="bid.466">
              <title>Participation in PMC</title>
              <p>Participation by publishers in PMC is voluntary, although participating journals must meet certain editorial standards. A participating journal is expected to include all of its peer-reviewed primary research articles in PMC. Journals are encouraged to also deposit other content such as review articles, essays, and editorials. Review journals, and similar publications that have no primary research articles, are also invited to include their contents in PMC. However, primary research papers without peer review are not accepted.</p>
              <p>Journals that deposit material in PMC may make the full text viewable directly in PMC or may require that PMC link to the journal site for viewing the complete article. In the latter case, the full text must be freely available at the journal site no more than 1 year after publication. In the case of full text that is viewable directly in PMC, which by definition is free, the journal may delay the release of its material for more than 1 year after publication, although all current journals have delays of 1 year or less.</p>
              <p>In either case, the journal must provide <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1400">SGML</xref> or <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1435">XML</xref> for the full text, along with any related high-resolution image files. All data must meet PMC standards for syntactically correct and complete data.</p>
              <p>The rationale behind the insistence on free access is that continued use of the material, which is encouraged by open access, serves as the best test of the durability and utility of the archive as technology changes over time. PMC does not claim copyright on any material deposited in the archive. Copyright remains with the journal publisher or with individual authors, whichever is applicable.</p>
              <p>Refer to <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pubmedcentral.gov/about/pubinfo.html">Information for Publishers</ext-link> to learn more about participating in PMC.</p>

              <title>Links to Other NCBI Resources</title>
              <p>From Abstract and Full Text pages in PMC are links to related articles in PubMed and to related records in other Entrez databases, such as Nucleotides or Books. These are identical to the links between databases that you can find in any Entrez record.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec id="bid.468">
              <title>PMC Architecture</title>
              <p>PubMed Central is an XML-based publishing system for full-text journal articles. All journal content in the archive was either supplied in, or has been converted to, a Document Type Definition (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1277">DTD</xref>) written at <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1353">NCBI</xref> for the publication and storage of full-text articles.</p>
              <p>The content is displayed dynamically on the PMC site by journal, volume, and issue (if applicable). XML, Web graphics, PDFs, and supplemental data are stored in a <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1413">Sybase</xref> database. When a reader requests an article, the XML is retrieved from the database, and it is converted to <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1312">HTML</xref> using <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1437">XSLT</xref> stylesheets. The look of the HTML pages is controlled further by using Cascading Style Sheets (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1269">CSS</xref>), which allow manipulation of colors, fonts, and typefaces.</p>

            <sec id="bid.469">
              <title>Data Flow: 1. SGML/XML Processing</title>
              <p>We receive journal content either directly from publishers or from publishers' vendors. This content includes:
                <list list-type="bullet">
                  <list-item id="bid.470">
                    <p> SGML or XML of the articles to be deposited</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item id="bid.471">
                    <p> High-resolution images</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item id="bid.472">
                    <p> Supplemental data associated with the articles</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item id="bid.473">
                    <p> PDF versions of the articles</p>
                  </list-item>
                </list>
              </p>
              <p>All of the text is converted to a central DTD, the PMC DTD, and the images are converted to Web format (GIF and JPEG). These files, along with any supplemental data or PDFs, are loaded into the database for linking, indexing, and retrieval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.474">Figure 8</xref>). The source text in SGML or XML format is parsed against the source DTD. If the source files do not conform to the DTD, they are returned to the publisher or vendor for correction.<fig id="bid.474"><label>8</label><caption><title>Data flow.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch9f8" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>
              <p>Once all of the files in an issue or batch have been validated, they are converted to PMC XML (referred to as a PMC XML file or PXML) using XSLT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.475">Figure 9</xref>). Because XSLT is an XML conversion tool, SGML source files must first be converted to XML. This is done using SX, which is available from <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jclark.com/sp/index.htm">James Clark</ext-link>. The transformation will close any empty elements and insert ending tags for any element that is not closed.<fig id="bid.475"><label>9</label><caption><title>Text conversion flow.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch9f9" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>
              <p>For each publisher that submits SGML, an XML version of the DTD is created. This is used to parse the output of SX before the XML conversion is started. The XML version of the publisher's DTD is not used to validate the source data (because this has already been done using the original DTD).</p>
              <p>XSLT requires that the input file be valid XML. If a DTD is not available for validation, the parser will check the syntax; it will also replace all of the character entities with the appropriate <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1428">UTF-8</xref> representation. This can cause a problem because the relationship between the characters in the input file and their UTF-8 representations may not be one to one. This means that characters translated to UTF-8 might not translate back to the original character entity accurately.</p>
              <p>After the XSLT conversion, the original character entities are converted to character entities that are valid under the PMC DTD. Character translation tables for each source DTD regulate this conversion.</p>
              <p>The resulting XML is then validated against the PMC DTD.</p>
              <p>Several other items are created along with the PXML file. These are:</p>
              <p>1. An entity file (articlename.ent). This file lists all of the character entities (from the PMC DTD-defined entity sets) that are in the article. One entity file is created for each article. This information is loaded into the database and is used to prepare the final HTML file for display. A sample is below:
                <preformat>
    agr
    deg
    Dgr
    ldquo
    lsqb
    lt
    pmc811
    mdash</preformat>
              </p>
              <p>2. A PubMedID file (articlename.pmid). This file includes a set of reference citations in the format
                  <preformat>
Journal_Title|year|volume|first_page|AuthorName|Refno|pubmedid</preformat>
</p>
              <p>When the article is converted, this information is collected from each journal citation in the bibliography and sent in a query to PubMed (using the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/getids.cgi">Citation Matcher</ext-link> utility). If a value is returned, it is written in the last field. If no value is returned, an error message is written in this field. This information is saved so that if the article ever needs to be reconverted, the PubMed IDs will not need to be looked up again. A sample is below:

              <p>3. A source node file (articlename.src). When an article is passed through the XSLT conversion, a list is made of each node, or named piece of information, that is included in the file. As the conversion is running, each node that is being processed is recorded. When the conversion is complete, the processed node list is compared with the list of nodes in the source file, and any piece of information that was not processed is reported in a conversion log.

                <title>Image Processing</title>
                <p>To accommodate the archiving requirements of the PubMed Central project, it is important that figures be submitted in the greatest resolution possible, in TIFF or EPS format. Figures in these formats will be available for data migration when formats change in the future, and PubMed Central will be able to keep all of the figures current.</p>
                <p>For display on the PMC site, two copies of each figure are made: a GIF thumbnail (100 pixels wide) and a JPEG file that will be displayed with the figure caption when the figure is requested.</p>

                <title>Supplemental Data Processing</title>
                <p>Supplemental data include any supporting information that accompanies the article but is not part of the article. They may be text files, Word document files, spreadsheet files, executables, video, and others.</p>
                <p>Sometimes a journal has a Web site where all of this supplemental information is stored. In this case, PubMed Central establishes links from the article to the supplemental information on the publisher's site.</p>
                <p>In other cases, the supplemental data files are submitted with the article to be loaded into the PMC database. Either way, the information concerning this supplemental data is collected in a Supplemental Data file, which includes the location of the supplemental file(s), the type of information that is available, and how the link should be built from the article. PMC does not validate any of the supplemental data files that are supplied.</p>

                <title>Mathematics</title>
                <p>Mathematical symbols and notations can be difficult to display in HTML because of built-up expressions and unusual characters. For the most part, expressions that are simple enough to display using HTML are not handled as math unless they are tagged as math specifically. Publishers that supply content to PMC handle math expressions in one of two ways: supplied images or encoding in SGML.</p>
                <sec id="bid.479">
                  <title>1. Math Images</title>
                  <p>Any expression that cannot be tagged by the source DTD is supplied as an image. In this case, PMC will pass the image callout through to the PXML file and display the supplied image in the HTML file.</p>

                <sec id="bid.480">
                  <title>2. Math in SGML</title>
                  <p>Several of the Source DTDs used by publishers to submit data to PMC are robust enough to allow coding of almost any mathematical expression in SGML. Most of these were derived from the Elsevier DTD; therefore, many of the elements are similar.</p>
                  <p>During article conversion, any items that are recognized as math are translated into Te&chi;. This would include any expression tagged specifically as a &ldquo;formula&rdquo; or &ldquo;display formula,&rdquo; as well as any free-standing expression that cannot be represented in HTML. These expressions include radicals, fractions, and anything with an overbar (other than accented characters). For example:
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>&ldquo;<italic>x</italic> + <italic>y</italic> = 2<italic>z</italic>&rdquo; would not be recognized as a math expression, but &ldquo;&lt;formula&gt;<italic>x</italic> + <italic>y</italic> = 2<italic>z</italic>&lt;/formula&gt;&rdquo; would be.</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>&ldquo;1/2&rdquo; would not be recognized as a math expression, but &lt;fraction&gt;&lt;numerator&gt;1&lt;/numerator&gt;&lt;denominator&gt;2 &lt;/denominator&gt;&lt;/fraction&gt; would be.</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>&ldquo;&lt;radical&gt;2x&lt;/radical&gt;&rdquo; would be recognized as a math expression, as would &ldquo;&lt;overbar&gt;47X&lt;/overbar&gt;.&rdquo;</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  </p>

              <title>Data Flow: 2. Loading the Database</title>
              <p>Because all of the content in PubMed Central is in the same format&mdash;PMC DTD&mdash;loading articles into the database is relatively straightforward. Once an article is loaded into the production (public) database, it will retain its ArticleId (article ID number) in perpetuity. On loading, each article is validated against the PMC DTD. Also, any external files that are referenced by the XML are checked. If any file, such as a figure, is missing, the loading will be aborted.</p>
              <p>The database loading software and daily maintenance programs perform several other tests to ensure the accuracy and vitality of the archive:
                <list list-type="arabic">
                  <list-item id="bid.483">
                    <label>1</label>
                    <p>Journal identity. The Journal title being loaded is verified against the <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1327">ISSN</xref> number in the PXML to verify that the journal identity is correct.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item id="bid.484">
                    <label>2</label>
                    <p>Duplicate articles. An article may not be loaded more than once. Any changes to the article must be submitted as a replacement article, which will use the same ArticleId.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item id="bid.485">
                    <label>3</label>
                    <p>Publication date/delay. Rules for delay of publication embargo can be set up in the database to ensure that an issue will not be released to the public before a certain amount of time has passed since the publisher made the issue available.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item id="bid.486">
                    <label>4</label>
                    <p>PubMed IDs. PubMedIDs for the article being loaded or any bibliographic citation in the article that are not defined in the PXML are looked up upon loading.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item id="bid.487">
                    <label>5</label>
                    <p>Link updates. Links between related articles and from articles to external sources are updated daily.</p>

              <p>PubMed Central uses a number of standard <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1326">ISO</xref> character sets (8879 and 9573), along with a set of characters that has been defined to accommodate characters not in the standard set. The ISO Standard Character sets referenced are listed in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bid.489">Box 1</xref>.
		</p>
              <p>Each publisher DTD defines a set of characters that may be used in their articles. Generally, these publisher DTDs use the same standard ISO character sets listed in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bid.489">Box 1</xref>. Any character that cannot be represented by the standard ISO sets is defined in a publisher-specific character set. These publisher-specified characters are converted into characters in the PMC entity list during conversion (see <italic>SGML/XML Processing</italic>). The PMC <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/pmcdoc/dtd/pmc.ent">entity list</ext-link> is publicly available.</p>
              <p>The supplied data also include groups of entities that are to be combined in the final document. Sometimes these are grouped in a tag such as:
				<preformat>    &lt;A&gt;&lt;AC&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/AC&gt;&lt;AC&gt;&amp;acute;&lt;/AC&gt;&lt;/A&gt;</preformat></p>
              <p>and sometimes they are just positioned next to each other in the text. These combined entities must be mapped either to an ISO character or to a character in the PMC character set.</p>
              <p>For the most flexibility in displaying characters across platforms, PMC uses UTF-8 encoding whenever possible. Because not all browsers support the same subset of UTF-8 characters and some characters cannot be represented in UTF-8, PMC displays characters as a combination of GIFs and UTF-8 characters, depending on the Browser/OS combination and the character to be displayed.</p>

                <title>History</title>
                <p>In the first version of the PMC project, the SGML and XML were loaded into a database in its native format. The HTML rendering software was then required to convert content from different sources into normalized HTML on the fly when a reader requested an article.</p>
                <p>This was slow and cumbersome on the rendering side and was not scaleable. At that time, PMC was receiving content for about five journals in two DTDs, the keton.dtd from HighWire Press and the article.dtd from BioMed Central. The set-up for a new journal was difficult, and it soon became obvious that this solution would not scale easily.</p>
                <p>To satisfy the archiving requirement for the PMC project and to simplify the delivery of articles online, PubMed Central decided to convert all content into a centralized format. The normalized content is easier to render, allows enhanced value such as links to other NCBI databases to be added, and simplifies content archiving.</p>
                <p>PMC created a new DTD, which was strongly influenced by the BioMedCentral article.dtd and the keton.dtd. The original emphasis was on simplicity. As more and more articles from more and more journals were converted to the PMC DTD, changes had to be made to accommodate the data. The <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/pmcdoc/dtd/pmc-1.dtd">PMC DTD</ext-link> is publicly available.</p>

                <title>Review and Revision of the PMC DTD</title>
                <p>Because the PMC DTD grew rapidly, it was feared that the original &ldquo;simplicity&rdquo; of its design would lead to confusing data structures. With more and more publishers inquiring about submitting content directly in the PMC DTD, PubMed Central decided that an independent review was necessary. <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mulberrytech.com">Mulberry Technologies, Inc.</ext-link>, an electronic publishing consultancy specializing in SGML- and XML-based systems, reviewed the DTD and created a modified version.</p>
                <p>At approximately the same time, under the auspices of a Mellon Grant to explore ejournal archiving, Harvard University Library contracted with <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.inera.com">Inera, Inc.</ext-link> to review a variety of DTDs from selected publishers, PMC included. The study focused on two key questions:

SKY permits the simultaneous visualization of all human or mouse chromosomes in a different color, facilitating the detection of chromosomal translocations and rearrangements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.499">Figure 1</xref>). CGH uses the hybridization of differentially labeled tumor and reference DNA to generate a map of DNA copy number changes in tumor genomes.</p>
              <p>The goal of the SKY/CGH database is to allow investigators to submit and analyze both clinical and research (e.g., cell lines) SKY and CGH data. The database is growing and currently has a total of about 700 datasets, some of which are being held private until published. Several hundred labs around the world use this technique, with many more looking at the data they generate. Submitters can enter data from their own cases in either of two formats, public or private; the public data is generally that which has already been published, whereas the private data can be viewed only by the submitters, who can transfer it to the public format at their discretion. The results are stored under the name of the submitter and are listed according to case number. The <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sky/">homepage</ext-link> includes a basic description of SKY and CGH techniques and provides links to a more detailed explanation and relevant literature.</p>

                  <title>Karyotype Parser</title>
                  <p>To speed up the entry of cytogenetic data into the database, NCBI has built a computer program to automatically read short-form karyotypes, extract the information therein, and insert it into the SKY database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.513">Figure 7</xref>). Karyotypes are written according to specific rules described in <italic>An International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (1995)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.535">12</xref>). Using these rules, the parser (1) breaks the karyotype into small syntactic components, (2) assembles information from these components into an information structure in computer memory, (3) transforms this information into the formats required for an application, and (4) uses the information in the application, i.e., inserts it into the database. To accomplish this, the syntactic parser first extracts the information out of each piece of the input; the pieces are then put directly into a tree structure that represents karyotype semantics. For insertion into the SKY database, the karyotype information is transformed into ASN.1 structures that reflect the design of the database.<fig id="bid.513"><label>7</label><caption><title>Karyotype Parser.</title><p>The short-form written karyotype, entered in the karyotype field in (<italic>a</italic>), has been converted into a modified long-form karyotype (<italic>b</italic>), which describes each abnormal chromosome from <italic>top</italic> to <italic>bottom</italic>.

              <title>Summary</title>
              <p>One of the most intensely studied regions of the human genome is the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), a group of genes that occupies approximately 4&ndash;6 megabases on the short arm of chromosome 6. The MHC genes, known in humans as Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) genes, are highly polymorphic and encode molecules involved in the immune response. The MHC database, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mhc">dbMHC</ext-link>, was designed to provide a neutral platform where the HLA community can submit, edit, view, and exchange MHC data. It currently consists of an interactive Alignment Viewer for HLA and related genes, an MHC microsatellite database (dbMHCms), a sequence interpretation site for Sequencing Based Typing (SBT), and a Primer/Probe database. dbMHC staff are in the process of creating a new database that will house a wide variety of HLA data including:

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The most important known function of HLA genes is the presentation of processed peptides (antigens) to T cells, although there are many genes in the HLA region yet to be characterized, and work continues to locate and analyze new genes in and around the MHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.1908">1</xref>&ndash;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.1911">4</xref>). The vast amount of work required to elucidate the MHC led to a series of International Histocompatibility Workshop/Conferences (IHWCs). These conferences were the genesis for the IHWG, a group of researchers actively involved in projects that lead to shared data resources for the HLA community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.1912">5</xref>&ndash;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.1923">16</xref>). dbMHC is a permanent public archive that was conceived by the IHWG and is implemented and hosted by NCBI. This database is intended to be expandable; if you have ideas for additional resources, please send an email to <email>helmberg@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</email>.</p>
              <p>The staff of the MHC database are currently accepting online submissions for the Primer/Probe/Mix component of dbMHC. Submissions can include typing data from any of the following: Sequence Specific Oligonucleotides (SSOs), Sequence Specific Primers (SSPs), SSO and/or SSP mixes, HLA typing kits, and Sequencing Based Typing (SBT). dbMHC allows submitters to edit their submissions online at any time.</p>

It offers an interactive display of the alignment, where users can select alleles, highlight SNPs within the alignment, and change between a Codon display and a Decade display (blocks of 10 nucleotides). Users can also switch the type of display, from one where the sequence is completely written out to one where only the differences between selected sequences and a pre-selected reference sequence are seen. All sequences displayed in the Alignment Viewer can be downloaded and formatted as alignment, FASTA, or XML. If the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Alignment</named-content> option is selected, it is up to the user to define how the alignment should be organized. The <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Alignment</named-content> option allows the user to download the entire alignment, or just a section of it, and also allows the user to specify how the sequence will be displayed (e.g., in groups of 10 nucleotides or amino acids).</p>
                <p>dbMHC can be used as a tool to help design primers/probes, to evaluate the reactivity patterns of potential probes, and to evaluate the polymorphism content of a particular gene.</p>

The current format restricts input to text or FASTA-formatted sequence.</p>
                <p>Submitted sequences are aligned to reference locus sequences located in the dbMHC allele database based on a user-defined degree of nucleotide mismatch. After a brief analysis, the SBT interface will display exons, introns, and untranslated regions for each sequence. Allele assignments are listed according to matching order. Mismatched nucleotide positions are listed separately (in the lower frame of the SBT interface) after selecting <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Alignment</named-content>. Note that the SBT interface analyzes one or more sequences for a single locus. If sequences from multiple loci that have identical group-specific amplifications are submitted, the SBT interface must be used to analyze sequences from only one locus at a time.</p>

                    <p>If the user chooses to set the reactivity score as a batch, be aware that alleles within the batch that are not currently displayed will be scored as well. If the user makes a mistake in the scoring, <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Reset</named-content> will reset the reactivity scores to the values present at the beginning of the session.</p>
                    <p><named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Submit</named-content> stores the edited scores in the database. Once submitted, allele reactivity scores cannot be automatically reset to their prior value.</p>
                    <p>Submitting allele reactivity scores will trigger a new dbMHC allele reactivity calculation. If the submitted primer/probe sequence is shorter than 10 nucleotides, dbMHC will use the score information of the alleles to extend the probe sequence.</p>
                  </boxed-text>
                  <p>Selecting <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Aligned</named-content> from the Primer/Probe View results in a display of the reactive allele alignment in the lower frame of the Primer/Probe Interface. It displays the alleles that might be detected by a certain primer/probe or mix in alignment with that primer/probe sequence. By default, the first 20 alleles detected by the primer/probe or mix will be displayed. The frame for the reactive allele alignment also allows a submitter to set or edit the Allele Reactivity Score of a primer/probe in this frame. If a submitter chooses to not set a reactivity score, then dbMHC sets the submitter reactivity score to &ldquo;not edited&rdquo;. dbMHC will also calculate a system reactivity score for the primer/probe based on the primer/probe sequence and matching stringency. Colored option boxes indicate dbMHC's reactivity score for the primer/probe, whereas dots within the option boxes indicate the submitter's reactivity score. If the submitter's score (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bid.1832">Box 5</xref>) is set and differs from dbMHC's score, the dbMHC score box changes to a warning color.</p>
                  <p>The alignment position of the 3' end of the probe is recorded for each allele. Both the sense and the reverse alignment positions are displayed if the alignment represents an SSP mix.</p>
                  <p>Only users with permission from an account administrator will be able to edit or add additional alleles to a Reactive Allele Listing for a particular primer/probe or mix. To edit the allele reactivity list, mark the &ldquo;edit reactivity list&rdquo; check box in the reactive allele alignment frame.</p>

Users can access this information through multiple functional frames within the interface. Typing kits contained within the Typing Kit Interface consist of SSOs, SSO mixes, or SSP mixes. Elements of typing kits may interact with unamplified DNA, pre-amplified DNA, or several distinct groups of pre-amplified DNA within one locus (e.g., two different amplifications of a certain exon using a distinct variation). The elements of each typing kit will react in characteristic patterns with individual alleles. These patterns can be used to determine allelic variants or a group of allelic variants within a locus (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bid.1849">Box 6</xref>).</p>

Several typing kits that are used to type one sample can be analyzed in combination. An order number represents each element of a typing kit. This number provides a link to the probe reactivity alignment view of each element. The display also indicates whether, and for which elements, an allele-specific amplification has been used. Reactivity patterns can be entered either as a string or via the graphical display. Both the graphical display and the text field will update each other. The string entry accepts &ldquo;1&rdquo;, &ldquo;+&rdquo; for positive reactivity, &ldquo;0&rdquo;,&ldquo;-&rdquo; for negative reactivity, &ldquo;n&rdquo; for not tested, &ldquo;w&rdquo; for weak reactivity, and &ldquo;?&rdquo; for undetermined.

                  <p>Selecting <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Pattern</named-content> from the Typing Kit Interface results in a display (in the lower frame) of a cross-tab view of allele reactivities of an individual typing kit. Alleles are listed in rows, and kit elements are listed in columns. Each element of a typing kit is represented by the respective order number. This number provides a link to the probe reactivity alignment view of each element. The display also indicates whether and for which elements an allele-specific amplification has been used.</p>
                  <p>A &ldquo;+&rdquo; with a green background signals a detection of an allele by a kit element, a &ldquo;w&rdquo; with an orange background signals a weak detection, a &ldquo;?&rdquo; with a yellow background signals a lack of information, and an &ldquo;r&rdquo; with a red background signals a rejected interaction, although originally suggested by the prediction algorithm. If a kit is designed to detect only a subset of alleles, the display will be limited to this subset (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bid.1870">Box 9</xref>).</p>

                <title>Primer/Probe Database</title>
                <p>dbMHC's primer/probe database or interface is not curated. As such, the accuracy of the information presented in this database is dependent entirely upon the accuracy of the data submitted to dbMHC.</p>
                <p>We suggest that each primer or probe submitted should be characterized by its complete sequence. In cases where submission of the complete sequence is impossible because the sequence information is considered proprietary, dbMHC offers the option to submit partial sequences. Submitted primer/probe specifications should comply with American Society of Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics (ASHI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.1927">20</xref>) and European Federation of Immunogenetics (EFI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.1928">21</xref>) standards for primers/probes used in histocompatibility DNA testing. If the submitted sequence contains fewer than 10 nucleotides, the submitter must also provide the position of the 3' end of the probe within the alignment of a locus. This additional information is necessary because the likelihood of a primer/probe reactivity calculation producing multiple erroneous alignment positions becomes too great if dbMHC calculates it with fewer than 10 nucleotides.</p>

                <title>Reagent Allele Reactivity Prediction</title>
                <p>The allele reactivity prediction tool for primers and probes available through dbMHC presents calculations based solely on sequence similarity and can therefore offer only suggestions for the possible allele reactivities of individual primers and probes. Users should not consider this tool to be 100% accurate. A reliable prediction of primer/probe allele reactivities requires complete sequence information, as well as reaction data that include annealing temperature and magnesium concentration. Because these data are not consistently available to dbMHC, we are unable to offer more than a suggestion for primer/probe allele reactivity.</p>

                        <p>A 20-mer SSO anneals to a mismatched DNA. Both probe and template are shown in the sense orientation. The substitution of T with C leads to the probe-template mismatch T-G with a penalty of 0.42 (refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="bid.1885">Table 2</xref>).</p>
                        <p>This position has a 70% influence on the overall probe reactivity.</p>
                        <p>The overall probe score is 1 &minus; (0.7 &times; 0.42) = 0.71.</p>

                  </table-wrap>
                  <p>dbMHC uses a penalty system based on nucleotide position in its calculation of SSO/SSP interactions with different alleles. The system dbMHC uses indicates the extent to which an individual nucleotide position will affect the interaction stringency grade in a worst-case scenario, where guanines are in opposing sequence positions or cytosines are in opposing sequence positions. The maximum penalty given in the system is in the middle of an SSO and at the 3' end of an SSP, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="bid.1887">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="bid.1888">4</xref>.</p>
                  <p>If the initial interaction stringency grade for a particular primer/probe&ndash;allele interaction is 100% and a mismatch occurs in a position that carries a penalty of 100%, then dbMHC will reduce the interaction stringency grade to 0%. If the mismatch occurs in a position that carries a penalty of 95%, dbMHC will reduce the interaction stringency grade to 5%. A more detailed <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mhc/html/annealinghelp.html">example</ext-link> of how dbMHC computes primer/probe interaction stringency is available online.</p>
                  <p>dbMHC's reactive allele alignment algorithm searches for sequences with a match grade above the stringency level set by the submitter of each probe. Currently, the search algorithm searches within all loci that are part of dbMHC. Within each locus, the algorithm constructs compound sequences that represent the combined polymorphic positions of alleles of the same length. Alleles with insertions or deletions are handled separately. If a primer or probe matches with a certain position within the compound, all contributing alleles are checked for that position, whether or not they match.</p>
                  <p>The reactive allele alignment algorithm will check within a specified locus for sequences that have a match grade in accordance with primer/probe specifications at a user-indicated position. The algorithm then extends SSPs toward the 5' end of the probe, to a maximum of 10 nucleotides, and extends both sides of SSOs a maximum of 15 nucleotides, observing all polymorphic positions in matching alleles. The resulting probe extension is then used by the alignment algorithm to check for cross-reactivities within other loci.</p>
                  <p>If the submitted primer/probe sequence is shorter than 10 nucleotides and the user submits a score that accepts certain alleles and rejects others, the reactive allele alignment algorithm will use this information to refine the probe extension. If the probe submitter rejects all alleles containing a unique sequence motif in the vicinity of the probe sequence, the algorithm will generate the extended probe sequence such that it does not match the unique sequence motif.</p>

              <title>Summary</title>
              <p>Sequin is a stand-alone sequence record editor, designed for preparing new sequences for submission to GenBank and for editing existing records. Sequin runs on the most popular computer platforms found in biology laboratories, including PC, Macintosh, UNIX, and Linux. It can handle a wide range of sequence lengths and complexities, including entire chromosomes and large datasets from population or phylogenetic studies. Sequin is also used within NCBI by the GenBank and Reference Sequence indexers for routine processing of records before their release.</p>
              <p>Sequin has a modular construction, which simplifies its use, design, and implementation. Sequin relies on many components of the NCBI Toolkit and thus acts as a quality assurance that these functions are working properly.</p>
              <p>Detailed information on how to use Sequin to submit records to GenBank or edit sequence records can be found in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/QuickGuide/sequin.htm">Sequin Quick Guide</ext-link>. Although this chapter will make frequent reference to that help document, the focus will be mostly on the underlying concepts and software components upon which Sequin is built.</p>

              <title>Sequin: A Brief Overview</title>
              <p>As input, Sequin takes a biological sequence(s) from a scientist wanting to submit or edit sequence data. The sequence (or set of sequences) can be new information that has not yet been assigned a GenBank Accession number, or it can be an existing GenBank sequence record. If Sequin is being used to submit a sequence(s) to GenBank, then the scientist is prompted to include his/her contact information, information about other authors, and the sequence, at the start of the submission process. Once all the necessary information has been entered, it is then possible to view the sequence in a variety of displays and edit it using Sequin's suite of editing tools.</p>
              <p>Sequin is designed for use by people with different levels of expertise. Thus, it has several built-in functions that can, for example, ensure that a new user submits a valid sequence record to GenBank, or it can be prompted to automatically generate a sequence <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1273">definition line</xref>. At the other end of the scale, for computer-literate users, Sequin can be customized by the addition of more (perhaps research-specific) analysis functions. Furthermore, there are some extremely powerful functions built into Sequin that are only available to NCBI Indexing staff. These are switched off by default in the public download version of Sequin because they include the ability to make the kinds of changes to a sequence record that can also completely destroy it, if handled incorrectly. These various built-in Sequin functions are discussed further below.</p>
              <p>Sequin's versatility is based on its design: (<italic>a</italic>) Sequin holds the sequence(s) being manipulated in memory, in a structured format that allows a rapid response to the commands initiated by the person who is using Sequin; and (<italic>b</italic>) it makes use of many standard functions found in the <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1354">NCBI Toolkit</xref> for both basic data manipulations and as components of Sequin-specific tasks. In particular, Sequin makes heavy use of the Toolkit's object manager, a &ldquo;behind the scenes&rdquo; support system that keeps track of Sequin's internal data structures and the relationships of each piece of information to others. This allows many of Sequin's functions to operate independently of each other, making data manipulation much faster and making the program easier to maintain.</p>

              <title>Sequence Submission</title>
              <p>Sequin is used to edit and submit sequences to GenBank and handles a wide range of sequence lengths and complexities. After <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/download.html">downloading</ext-link> and installing Sequin, a scientist wanting to submit or edit a sequence(s) is led through a series of forms to input information about the sequence to be submitted. The forms are &ldquo;smart&rdquo;, and different forms will appear, customized to the type of submission. Detailed information on how to fill in these forms can be found within the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Help</named-content> feature of the Sequin application itself and in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/QuickGuide/sequin.htm">online Help</ext-link> documents.</p>
              <p>Sequin expects sequence data in <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1290">FASTA</xref> formatted files, which should be prepared as plain text before uploading them into Sequin. Population, phylogenetic, and mutation studies can also be entered in <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1373">PHYLIP</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1356">NEXUS</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1335">MACAW</xref>, or <!--<glossref>-->FASTA+GAP<!--</glossref>--> formats.</p>
              <p>A sequence in FASTA format consists of a definition line, which starts with a &ldquo;&gt;&rdquo;, and the sequence itself, which starts on a new line directly below the definition line. The definition line should contain the name or identifier of the sequence but may also include other useful information. In the case of nucleotides, the name of the source organism and strain should be included; for proteins, it is useful to include the gene and protein names. Given all this information, Sequin can automatically assemble a record suitable for inclusion in GenBank (see below). Detailed information on how to prepare FASTA files for Sequin can be found in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/QuickGuide/sequin.htm#before">Quick Guide</ext-link>.</p>
              <sec id="bid.541">
                <title>Single Sequences</title>
                <p>For single nucleotide sequence submissions to GenBank, the submitter supplies Sequin with the nucleotide sequence and any translated protein sequence(s). For example, a submission consisting of a nucleotide from mouse strain BALB/c that contains the &beta;-hemoglobin gene, encoding the adult major chain &beta;-hemoglobin protein, would have two sequences with the following definition lines, where &ldquo;BALB23g&rdquo; and &ldquo;BALB23p&rdquo; are nucleotide and protein IDs provided by the submitter:
                  <preformat>
    &gt; BALB23g [organism=Mus musculus] [strain=BALB/c]
    &gt; BALB23p [gene=Hbb-b1] [protein=hemoglobin, beta adult major chain]</preformat>
                </p>
                <p>The organism name is essential to make a legal GenBank <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1294">flatfile</xref>. It can be included in the definition line as shown above, for the convenience of the submitter, or one of the Sequin submission forms will prompt for its clarity.</p>
                <p>Although it is not necessary to include a protein translation with the nucleotide submission, scientists are strongly encouraged to do so because this, along with the source organism information, enables Sequin to automatically calculate the coding region (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1259">CDS</xref>) on the nucleotide being submitted. Furthermore, with gene and protein names properly annotated, the record becomes informative to other scientists who may retrieve it through a <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1246">BLAST</xref> or <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1282">Entrez</xref> search (see also <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.588">Chapter 15</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.610">Chapter 16</xref>).</p>

                <title>Segmented Nucleotide Sets</title>
                <p>A segmented nucleotide entry is a set of non-contiguous sequences that has a defined order and orientation. For example, a genomic DNA segmented set could include encoding exons along with fragments of their flanking introns. An example of an mRNA segmented pair of records would be the 5&prime; and 3&prime; ends of an mRNA where the middle region has not been sequenced. To import nucleotides in a segmented set, each individual sequence must be in FASTA format with an appropriate definition line, and all sequences should be in the same file.</p>

                <title>High-Throughput Genomic Sequences</title>
                <p>Genome Sequencing Centers use automated sequencing machines to rapidly produce large quantities of &ldquo;unfinished&rdquo; DNA sequence, called high-throughput genomic sequence (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1311">HTGS</xref>). These sequences are not usually annotated with any features, such as coding regions, at all, and in the initial phases are not of high (&ldquo;finished&rdquo;) quality.</p>
                <p>The sequencing machines produce intensity traces for the four fluorescent dyes that correspond to the four bases adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. Software such as <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1371">PHRED</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1370">PHRAP</xref> convert these raw traces into the sequence letters A, C, G, or T. PHRED is a base-calling program that &ldquo;reads&rdquo; the sequences of the DNA fragments and produces a quality score. With multiple overlapping reads to work on, PHRAP assembles the DNA fragments using the quality scores of PHRED, itself producing a quality score for each base. The resulting file, which PHRAP outputs in &ldquo;.ace&rdquo; format, consists of the sequence itself plus the associated quality scores. Sequin can use these files as input and assemble valid GenBank records from them. Further information on using Sequin to prepare a HTGS record can be found <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/HTGS/sequininfo.html">here</ext-link>.</p>

              <sec id="bid.544">
                <title>Feature Tables</title>
                <p>Some Genome Centers now analyze their sequences and record the base positions of a number of sequence features such as the gene, mRNA, or coding regions. Sequin can capture this information and include it in a GenBank submission as long as it is formatted correctly in a <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/table.html">feature table</ext-link>. Sequin can read a simple, five-column, tab-delimited file in which the first and second columns are the start and stop locations of the feature, respectively, the third column is the type of feature (the feature key&mdash;gene, mRNA, CDS, etc.), the fourth column is the qualifier name (e.g., &ldquo;product&rdquo;), and the fifth the qualifier value (e.g., the name of the protein or gene). The features for an entire bacterial genome can be read in seconds using 
this format. A sample features table is shown below.

                <title>Alignments</title>
                <p>Population, phylogenetic, and mutation studies all involve the alignment of a number of sequences with each other so that regions of sequence similarity are emphasized. Sometimes it is necessary to introduce gaps into the sequences to give the best alignment. Sequin reads several output formats from sequence and phylogenetic analysis programs, including PHYLIP, NEXUS, PAUP, or FASTA+GAP.</p>
                <p>The submitted sequence alignment represents the relationship between sequences. This inferred relationship allows Sequin to propagate features annotated on one sequence to the equivalent positions on the remaining sequences in the alignment. Feature propagation is one of the many editing functions possible in Sequin. Using this tool significantly reduces the time required to annotate an alignment submission.</p>

                <title>Automated Submission</title>
                <p>tbl2asn is a program that automates the submission of sequence records to GenBank. It uses many of the same functions as Sequin but is driven entirely by data files, and records need no additional manual editing before submission. Entire genomes, consisting of many chromosomes with feature annotation, can be processed in seconds using this method.</p>

              <title>Packaging the Submissions</title>
              <p>Sequences given to Sequin in the input data formats described in this chapter are retained within Sequin memory, allowing them to be manipulated in real time. For example, for submission to GenBank, the sequence is transformed from the Sequin internal structure to Abstract Syntax Notation 1 (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1242">ASN.1</xref>), the data description language in which GenBank records are stored. This is the format transmitted over the Internet when submitting to GenBank. Sequin can also output information in other formats, such as GenBank flatfile or <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1435">XML</xref>, for saving to a local file.</p>
              <p>Most sequence submissions are packaged into a BioseqSet, which contains one or more sequences (Bioseqs), along with supporting information that has been included by the submitter, such as source organism, type of molecule, sequence length, and so on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.547">Figure 1</xref>). There are different classes of BioseqSets; thus, a simple single nucleotide submission is called a nuc-prot set (a BioseqSet of class nuc-prot) containing the nucleotide and protein Bioseqs. Similarly, population, phylogenetic, and mutation sequences, along with alignments, are packaged into BioseqSets of classes pop-set, phy-set, and mut-set, respectively. The alignment information is extracted into a Seq-align, which is packaged as annotation (Seq-annot) associated with the BioseqSet. In the case of PHRAP quality scores, these are converted into a Seq-graph, which, similar to alignment information, is packaged in a Seq-annot; however, in this case it is associated with the nucleotide sequence and not the higher-level BioseqSet. The Seq-graph of PHRAP scores can be displayed in Sequin's Graphical view.<fig id="bid.547"><label>1</label><caption><title>The internal structure of a sequence record in Sequin, as seen in the Desktop window.</title><p>The display can be understood as a Venn diagram. Selecting the up or down arrow expands or contracts, respectively, the level of detail shown. In a typical submission of a protein-coding gene, a BioseqSet (of class &ldquo;nuc-prot&rdquo;) contains two Bioseqs, one for the nucleotide and one for the protein. Descriptors, such as BioSrc, can be packaged on the set and thus apply to all Bioseqs within the set. Features allow annotation on specific regions of a sequence. For example, the CDS location provides instructions to translate the DNA sequence into the protein product.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch12f1" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>
              <p>Features are usually packaged on the sequence indicated by their location. For example, the gene feature is packaged on the nucleotide Bioseq, and a protein feature is packaged on the protein Bioseq. Proteins are real sequences, and features such as mature peptides are annotated on the proteins in protein coordinates (although they can be mapped to nucleotide coordinates for display in a GenBank flatfile). A CDS (coding region) feature location points to the nucleotide, but the feature product points to the protein. For historical reasons, the CDS is usually packaged on the nuc-prot set instead of on the nucleotide sequence.</p>

              <p>After the record has been constructed, the features can be viewed in a variety of display formats (<xref ref-type="table" rid="bid.549">Table 1</xref>). These include the traditional GenBank or GenPept flatfiles, a graphical overview, the feature spans displayed over the actual sequence letters, and ASN.1. These formats are generated by components of the NCBI Toolkit.</p>
              <p>The different format generators all work independently from one another. When Sequin starts up, it registers a set of function procedures used to generate each display format. While issuing Sequin commands during manipulation of the sequence, appropriate messages (for example, &ldquo;generate the view from the internal sequence record&rdquo;, &ldquo;highlight this feature&rdquo;, &ldquo;export the view to the clipboard&rdquo;, etc.) are sent to the viewer by calling one of these procedures. Separate lists of registered formats are maintained for nucleotide, protein, and genome record types.</p>
              <p>Just as the different format generators do not need to know about each other, Sequin's viewer windows do not need to know about other Sequin viewer or editor windows that are active at the same time. When editing a sequence, the user may have several different views of the same sequence open at the same time (for example, a GenBank flatfile and a graphical view). Clicking on a feature in the graphical view will select the same feature in the GenBank flatfile, and double-clicking on a feature launches the specific editor for that feature. This type of communication between different windows is orchestrated by the NCBI Toolkit's object manager.</p>

                <title>The Sequence Editor</title>
                <p>The sequence editor is used like a text editor, with new sequence added at the position of the cursor. Furthermore, the sequence editor automatically adjusts the biological feature intervals as editing proceeds. For example, if 60 bases are pasted or typed onto the 5&prime; end of a sequence record, the sequence editor will shift all the features by 60 bases. This means that interval correction does not need to be done by hand. Prior to Sequin, it was usually easier to resubmit from scratch than to edit all of the feature intervals manually.</p>

                <title>The Feature Editors</title>
                <p>Feature editor windows have a common structure, organized by tabs (Figures 2&ndash;4). The first tab is for elements specific to the given feature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.552">Figure 2</xref>). For example, in a coding region editor, the first tab has controls for entering the coding region and reading frame. The second tab is for elements common to all sequence features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.1768">Figure 3</xref>). These include an exception flag, which allows explanations to be given for unusual events (e.g., RNA editing or non-consensus splice sites) and a comment (a free-text statement shown as &ldquo;/note&rdquo; in the flatfile). The last tab is a location spreadsheet allowing multiple feature intervals to be entered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.1769">Figure 4</xref>). For a coding region, these would reflect the boundaries of the exons used to encode the protein.<fig id="bid.552"><label>2</label><caption><title>The first feature editor tab, <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Coding Region</named-content>, allows entry of information specific to the given type of feature.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch12f2" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig><fig id="bid.1768"><label>3</label><caption><title>The <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Properties</named-content> tab is for entry of information common to all types of features.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch12f3" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig><fig id="bid.1769"><label>4</label><caption><title>The <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Location</named-content> tab has a spreadsheet for entry of feature locations.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch12f4" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>

              <title>Computational Functions of Sequin</title>
              <p>Sequin combines several NCBI Toolkit functions to perform many useful computations on the data in Sequin's memory.</p>
              <sec id="bid.554">
                <title>Automatic Annotation of Coding Regions</title>
                <p>When a nucleotide is submitted to GenBank using Sequin, it is essential to give the name of the source organism.  The submitter is also strongly encouraged to supply the translated protein sequence(s) for the nucleotide.</p>
                <p>Supplying the organism name allows Sequin to automatically find and use the correct genetic code for translating the nucleotide sequence to protein for the most frequently sequenced organisms. On the basis of only the genetic code and sequences of the nucleotide and protein products, Sequin will then calculate the location of the protein-coding region(s) on the nucleotide sequence. This is an extremely powerful function of Sequin. The ability to do this automatically, instead of by hand, has made sequence submission much faster and less error-prone.</p>
                <p>Sequin uses a reverse translating alignment algorithm, called Suggest Intervals, to locate the protein-coding region(s) on the nucleotide sequence. The algorithm builds a table of the positions of all possible stretches of three amino acids in the protein. It then translates the nucleotide in all six reading frames and searches for a match to one of these triplets. When it finds one, it attempts to extend the match on each side of the initial hit. If the extension hits a mismatch or an intron, it stops. Given these candidate regions of matching, Sequin then tries to find the best set of other identical regions that will generate a complete protein. While doing this, the algorithm takes <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1407">splice sites</xref> into account when deciding where to start an intron in eukaryotic sequences and fuses regions split by a single amino acid mismatch.</p>

                <title>Updating Sequence Records</title>
                <p>The ability to propagate features through an alignment and the way the sequence editor can adjust feature positions as the sequence is edited are combined in Sequin to provide a simple and automatic method for updating an existing sequence.</p>
                <p>The <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Update Sequence</named-content> function allows overlapping sequence or a replacement sequence to be included in an existing sequence record. Sequin makes an alignment (using the BLAST functions in the NCBI Toolkit), merges the sequence if necessary, and propagates features onto the new sequence in the new positions. This effectively replaces the old sequence and features. The <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Update Sequence</named-content> function is based on the NCBI Toolkit's alignment indexing, which allows Sequin to produce several displays that help the user to confirm that the correct sequence is in fact being processed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.556">Figure 5</xref>).
<fig id="bid.556"><label>5</label><caption><title>The Update Sequence window.</title><p>The <italic>top panel</italic> shows the overall relationship between the two sequences, including the parts that align and any parts that do not align. From these data, Sequin determines whether the user is updating with a 5&prime; overlap, 3&prime; overlap, or full replacement sequence, and it presets radio buttons to indicate the relationship. The <italic>second panel</italic> shows a simple graphical view of the positions of gaps and base mismatches in the old and new sequences. The <italic>third panel</italic> shows the same information but with the actual sequence letters.

              <sec id="bid.557">
                <title>The Validator</title>
                <p>The final version of the sequence, complete with all the annotated features, can be checked using the validator. This function checks for consistency and for the presence of required information for submission to GenBank. The validator searches for missing organism information, incorrect coding-region lengths (compared to the submitted protein sequence), internal stop codons in coding regions, mismatched amino acids, and non-consensus splice sites. Double-clicking on an item in the error report launches an editor on the &ldquo;offending&rdquo; feature. The NCBI Toolkit has a program (testval), which is a stand-alone version of the validator.</p>
                <p>The validator also checks for inconsistency between nucleotide and protein sequences, especially in coding regions, the protein product, and the protein feature on the product. For example, if the coding region is marked as incomplete at the 5&prime; end, the protein product and protein feature should be marked as incomplete at the amino end. (Unless told otherwise, the CDS editor will automatically synchronize these anomalies, facilitating the correction of this kind of inconsistency.)</p>
                <p>Additional checks include ensuring that all features are annotated within the range of the sequence, all feature location intervals are noted on the same DNA strand, tRNA codons conform to the given genetic code, and that there are no duplicate features or different genes with the same names. The validator even checks that the sequence letters are valid for the indicated alphabet (e.g., the letter &ldquo;E&rdquo; may appear in proteins but not in nucleotides).</p>
                <p>In cases where an exception has been flagged in a feature editor, specific validator tests can be disabled. For example, if the reason given for an exception is &ldquo;RNA editing&rdquo;, this turns off CDS translation checking in the validator. Likewise, &ldquo;ribosomal slippage&rdquo; disables exon splice checking, and &ldquo;trans splicing&rdquo; suppresses the error message that usually appears when feature intervals are indicated on different DNA strands.</p>

              <sec id="bid.559">
                <title>Automatic Definition Line Generator</title>
                <p>NCBI has a preferred format for the definition line in the GenBank format. It starts with the organism name, then the names of the protein products of coding regions (with the gene name in parentheses), with &ldquo;complete&rdquo; or &ldquo;partial&rdquo; at the end:
                  <preformat>
    DEFINITION Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 isolate ES-TMD envelope 
               glycoprotein (env) gene, partial cds.</preformat>
                </p>
                <p>There is also a standard style for explaining alternative splice products. Sequin's Automatic Definition Line Generator collects CDS, RNA, and exon features in the order that they appear on the nucleotide sequence, finds the relevant genes (usually by location overlap), and prepares a definition line that conforms to GenBank policy.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="bid.560">
                <title>Recalculation of Multiple CDS Features</title>
                <p>In spite of all the safeguards built into Sequin, a submitter sometimes uses an incorrect genetic code for an organism. This means that the protein products of CDS translations may be incorrect. Sequin can retranslate all CDS features with a single command. Even so, if the sequence being edited is large, for example, a whole chromosome, this can be a time-consuming operation. To speed it up, the NCBI Toolkit uses a finite state machine (an efficient pattern search algorithm) for rapid translation. The machine is primed with a given genetic code, and then nucleotide sequence letters are fed into the algorithm one at a time, in the order they appear in the sequence. This allows all six frames (three frames on each strand) to be translated in the least possible time. The <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Open Reading Frame</named-content> search in the NCBI Toolkit's tbl2asn program also uses this function.</p>

                <title>The Special Menu</title>
                <p>The Special Menu of Sequin encompasses a powerful set of tools that are available to GenBank and Reference Sequence indexers only. The Special Menu is not available to the public in the standard release because without a thorough understanding of the NCBI Data Model, use of the functions can cause irreparable damage to a record. It allows indexers to globally edit features, qualifiers, or descriptors in all sequences in a record, so that the same correction does not have to be made at each occurrence of the error. For example, all CDS features with internal stop codons can be converted to pseudogenes. Another common error made by submitters is to enter a repeat unit (a rpt_unit; e.g., ATTGG) in the repeat-type field (a rpt_type; e.g., tandem repeat). The Special Menu allows indexing staff to convert rpt_type to rpt_unit throughout the record.</p>

              <sec id="bid.1654">
                <title>NCBI Desktop Window</title>
                <p>Although Sequin has editors for changing specific fields and Special Menu functions for doing bulk changes on several features, it is not possible to anticipate all of the manipulations NCBI indexers might need to do to clean up a problem record. The NCBI Desktop window shows the internal structure of a record (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.547">Figure 1</xref>), i.e., how Bioseqs are packaged within Bioseq-sets, and where features, alignments, graphs, and descriptors are packaged on the sequences or sets. Objects (sets, sequences, features, etc.) can be dragged out of the record or moved to a different place in the record. Such manipulations could break the validity of the sequence record; therefore, great care must be taken when using it.</p>
                <p>For technically adept Sequin users, the Desktop is where additional analysis functions can be added to Sequin without building a complicated user interface. With a feature or sequence selected, items in the Filter menu perform specific analyses on the selected objects. The standard filters include reverse, complement, and reverse complement of a sequence, and reverse complement of a sequence and all of its features. These are needed to repair the occasional record that came in on the wrong strand or in 3&prime;&rarr;5&prime; direction. Adding new filter functions requires adding code to one of the Sequin source code files (one is provided with no other code in it for this purpose) and recompiling the program.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="bid.1655">
                <title>Network Analysis Functions</title>
                <p>The functions of Sequin can be expanded by the addition of a configuration file that specifies the URLs for other programs (CGI scripts) available from the Internet. For example, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/tRNAscan-SE/">tRNAscan-SE</ext-link>, a program by Sean Eddy and colleagues at Washington University (St. Louis, MO), can be used on sequences in Sequin in this way.</p>
                <p>At a minimum, the CGI should be able to read FASTA format and should return either sequence data or the five-column feature table (discussed above) as its result. The external programs that Sequin knows about appear in the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Analysis</named-content> menu. When one of these analyses is triggered, Sequin sends a message to the URL and checks for the result with a timer so that the user can continue to work while the (Web) server is processing the request. The code for the CGI that chaperones data from Sequin to tRNAscan-SE and converts the tRNAscan results to a five-column feature table is in the demo directory of the public NCBI Toolkit.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="bid.1656">
                <title>Network Fetch Functions</title>
                <p>As sequencing of complete bacterial genomes and eukaryotic chromosomes becomes more commonplace, the demand to break up long sequences into more manageable bites has increased (although Sequin is perfectly capable of editing these large records). Some genomes at NCBI are thus represented as segmented (or delta) Bioseqs, which are composed of pointers to other raw sequences in GenBank. Obtaining the entire sequence and all of the features requires fetching the individual components from a network service.</p>
                <p>The object manager allows Sequin to know about different fetch functions that can be used. When a sequence is needed, these functions will be called until one of them satisfies the request. For example, the lsqfetch configuration file can be edited to point to a directory containing sequence files on a user's disk. The SeqFetch function calls a network service at NCBI to obtain sequences and to look up Accession numbers given gi numbers or gi numbers given Accession numbers.</p>
                <p>When used internally by NCBI indexers, Sequin can also fetch records from the DirSub and TMSmart databases. To ensure the confidentiality of pre-released records, this access requires the indexer to have a database password and to be working from a computer within NCBI. For additional protection, the paths to the database scripts are stored in a configuration file and are not encoded in the public Sequin source code.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Sequin has an important dual role as a primary submission tool and as a full-featured sequence record editor. It is designed to be modular on several levels, which simplifies the design and implementation of its components. Sequin sits at the top of the NCBI software Toolkit, relying on many of the underlying components, and thus acts as a quality assurance that these functions are working properly.</p>

search and retrieval system (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.588">Chapter

Underlying the submission, storage, and access processes seen by users of GenBank, BLAST, and other curated data resources [such as the Reference Sequences (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.681">Chapter 18</xref>), the Map Viewer (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1562">Chapter 20</xref>), or LocusLink (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.788">Chapter 19</xref>)] is an information management system that consists of two major components, the ID database and the IQ database. Whereas ID handles incoming sequences and feeds other databases with subsets to suit different needs, IQ holds links between sequences from ID and links from these sequences to other resources. This chapter discusses these resources in more detail.</p>

                <title>Abstract Syntax Notation 1 (ASN.1) Is the Data Format Used by the ID System</title>
                <p><xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1242">ASN.1</xref> is the data description language in which all sequence data at NCBI are structured. ASN.1 allows a detailed description of both the sequences and the information associated with them, e.g., author names, source organism, and sequence features. Maintaining all of the data in the same structured format simplifies data parsing, manipulation, and quality assurance, as well as making data integration and the development of software for sequence analysis easier. All of the various divisions of GenBank can be downloaded in ASN.1 from the NCBI <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/ncbi-asn1">FTP site</ext-link>. Similar to an XML <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1277">DTD</xref>, ASN.1 has associated with it a description of the legal data structures; this file is called asn.all and is available by <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/toolbox/ncbi_tools/">FTP</ext-link> in the ASN directory from the file, ncbi.tar.Z. The DEMO directory of this same file contains the tool, testval, which validates the data against asn.all. There is also a set of utilities for producing ASN.1 while programming in C; these are largely in the subutil.c file of the API directory. In the ID data management system, data are stored as ASN.1 blob, minimizing the amount of biological information that needs be captured and updated in the relational database schema.</p>

Generally, large-volume submitters, such as HTGS, use FTP, often after using tools such as fa2htgs to convert their data to ASN.1. Small-volume submitters typically use either BankIt (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.2">Chapter 1</xref>) or Sequin (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.538">Chapter 12</xref>) to prepare the ASN.1 for submission.</p>
                <p>The data received are subject to some quality control. The submission tools BankIt, Sequin, and fa2htgs have built-in validation mechanisms that ensure that the data submitted have the correct structure and contain the essential information. The work of the GenBank indexing staff, who also use Sequin, adds an additional layer of quality control and provides assistance with problems or complex submissions and updates.</p>

                <title>The ID Database</title>
                <p>The ID database is a group of standard relational databases that holds both ASN.1 objects and sequence identifier-related information. ASN.1 objects follow the specifications in the asn.all file for NCBI sequence data objects. ID holds data for GenBank and other data, all of which are included in Entrez. All of the sequences for the International Nucleic Acid Database Collaboration are in GenBank and must have Accession numbers assigned to them. These Accession numbers define an entity, the sequence of which is described. When the understanding of that sequence changes, the sequence can have a new version. This leads to two parallel ways of tracking sequence versions for an object. In the GenBank flatfile format, there is an Accession.Version, where the version gives the ordinal instance (version) of the sequence. Within ID, each unique sequence is assigned a gi number; therefore, the chain of gi numbers for an Accession also gives all of the instances of the sequence for that Accession. The chain identifier within ID can be used to link these gi numbers. (Not all sequences within ID are in GenBank and not all have sequence versions, but all sequences have a chain of gi numbers. For this reason, internally, the gi number is the universal pointer to a particular sequence, as opposed to the Accession.Version, which would work only for versioned sequences.) The ID database is also the controller for allowed &ldquo;takeovers&rdquo; of one Accession by another. A takeover would occur, for example, when two clones' sequences were now to be merged into a single clone. One or both of the two older clones' Accessions could be taken over by the new clone. The actual details of the architecture of this group of databases and software associated with it are described later in this chapter.</p>

                <title>Output of Data from the ID System</title>
                <p>Once all incoming data have been converted to ASN.1 format and have been entered into ID, the data are then replicated to several different servers and also transformed into several different formats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.579">Figure 2</xref>). The replication is necessary for a number of reasons: (1) it separates the &ldquo;incoming&rdquo; data system (ID) from the &ldquo;outgoing&rdquo; data, i.e., the data served in response to scientific queries by users; (2) replicating the data to different servers helps balance the load of queries, thus providing quicker response times, and allows different servers to specialize in different functions; and (3) it protects against data loss; having copies kept at different locations means that the data are safe, should one server fail.<fig id="bid.579"><label>2</label><caption><title>Products of the ID system.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch13f2" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>

                <title>The IQ Database</title>
                <p>The IQ database is a <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1413">Sybase</xref> data-warehousing product that preserves its SQL language interface but inverts the data it stores so that the data are stored by column, not by row. Its strength is that it can speed up results from queries based on the anticipated indexing. This non-relational database holds links between many different objects.</p>
                <p>For example, as part of the processing of incoming sequences, each protein and nucleotide sequence is searched (using BLAST, <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.610">Chapter 16</xref>) against the rest of the database for similar sequences. The resulting set of similar sequences (sometimes known as &ldquo;neighbors&rdquo;) are made available to users by selecting the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">related sequences</named-content> link next to a record in Entrez (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.588">Chapter 15</xref>). The IQ database keeps track of the neighbors for any given sequence; these relationships are all precomputed to save time for the people using this feature.</p>
                <p>As well as storing the relationships between nucleotide or between proteins, IQ also holds information on the links between entries in different Entrez databases. This might include, for example, information on the publications cited within sequence records (which link to PubMed), or to an organism in the Taxonomy database. Some of this information comes from the analysis of the ASN.1 in ID by e2index.</p>

                <title>The GenBank Flatfile and Error Capture Databases</title>
                <p>Many people who use NCBI services think of the GenBank flatfile as the archetypal sequence data format. However, in terms of the ID internal data flow system, ASN.1 is considered the original format from which reports such as the GenBank flatfile can be generated. Generally, the GenBank flatfile is generated on demand from the ASN.1. However, for certain products, such as complete GenBank releases, a GenBank flatfile image is made for each active sequence and is stored in a database called FF4Release, which consists of the latest transformation of ASN.1 to the GenBank flatfile format.</p>
                <p>This database also doubles as the place where internal error reports are captured. The reports can be analyzed and displayed for different time points in the data processing pathway: (<italic>a</italic>) ASN.1 itself can be validated using the testval tool. (Syntax checking is not necessary, because the underlying ASN.1 libraries enforce proper syntax according to the definition file.); (<italic>b</italic>) errors can be discovered during conversion to GenBank flatfile format; and (<italic>c</italic>) through a reparse from GenBank flatfile format to ASN.1. This is done as a further check for legality of the ASN.1, and our current software for producing GenBank format reports from it.</p>

                <p>When sequences are submitted to GenBank or one of the collaborating databases, useful information about the sequence is often also included. This might include a brief description of a gene in the definition line, along with annotated sequence features, e.g., the source organism name. To make this information searchable via Entrez, these words have to be indexed. They are therefore extracted from the ASN.1 (using a tool called e2index) and are then stored in the Entrez posting files, which are optimized for Boolean queries by the Entrez system (see <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.588">Chapter 15</xref>).</p>

              <title>Data Flow Architecture</title>
              <p>ID has a distributed architecture, the features of which are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.586">Figure 3</xref>. The system is activated when a client (internal to NCBI) is ready to load data into the ID system. A stand-alone program takes ASN.1-containing files, while a client API can submit data to ID through the IDProdOS. The rationale behind the various architecture components is discussed below.</p>
              <p>IDProdOS is an open server (commonly called &ldquo;middleware&rdquo;), which sits between the clients and the database system. It hides details of the underlying complexity from the client API. For example, the previous version of the ID system consisted of a single database. &ldquo;Using the Open Server&rdquo; meant that when the conversion to the current system took place, only the open server had to be changed, and none of the clients. IDProdOS begins the complex process of checking that the actions implied by the load are allowed and changes the SeqId pointers to gi numbers to be used as sequence-specific pointers. For example, in a record that has DNA and protein sequences, including annotation and sequence identifiers, the identifier on the protein has to be unique. If the identifier has been used previously on another DNA sequence and the current sequence is not replacing the previous sequence, then this is not allowed because proteins are not allowed to move between GenBank records. As an exception, this rule is sometimes relaxed for proteins moving between segments of a complete genome submission.</p>
              <p>The IdMain database contains the sequence identifiers for each of the sequence records, including all those for ASN.1 blobs that contain multiple sequences. It enforces sequence version rules, among others.</p>
              <p>Relational satellite databases are fully normalized databases that hold records for which there is only one sequence per intended ASN.1 blob. Few, if any, features are allowed on records intended for relational satellite databases. (The PubSeqOS produces the ASN.1 by querying the relational tables.) This is in contrast to the Blob satellite databases, from which ASN.1 is retrieved pre-made.</p>
              <p>Blob satellite databases, although relational databases, contain ASN.1 objects as unnormalized data objects.</p>
              <p>The SnpAnnot database contains only feature information. It has simple mutation information from dbSNP (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1143">Chapter 5</xref>), which is added to NCBI-curated records by the PubSeqOS when the records are requested.</p>
              <p>To visualize the role of replication, the rectangle in the middle of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.586">Figure 3</xref> represents the use of the Sybase Replication Server to copy information from the loading side of the system to the query side.</p>
              <p>PubSeqOS is an open server (commonly called &ldquo;middleware&rdquo;) that sits between the clients and the database system. It hides details of the underlying complexity from the client API. It actually has an almost identical code base to IDProdOS because it serves similar functions. When the ASN.1 that has been requested is to be presented in a format other than ASN.1, psansconvert is called to do the conversion. This separate process allows both insulation from any possible instability and allows for use of multiple central processing units in a natural way.</p>
              <p>The EntrezControl and The Graveyards databases are uniquely on the query side. The EntrezControl database controls information on records that await indexing and have been indexed by e2index.The Graveyards are blob databases and contain those blobs killed by replacement or that were taken over by other blobs. Once taken over, blobs are not changed; therefore, they need not be on the loading side.<fig id="bid.586"><label>3</label><caption><title>The ID system architecture.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch13f3" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>

                <title>Annotation of other genomes.</title>
                <p>NCBI may assemble a genome prior to annotation, add annotations to a genome assembled elsewhere, or simply process an annotated genome to produce RefSeqs and maps for display in Map Viewer (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1562">Chapter 20</xref>).</p>
                <p>The basic procedures used to annotate other eukaryotic genomes are essentially the same as those used to annotate the human genome. However, the overall process is adjusted to accommodate the different types of input data that are available for each organism. Genes can be annotated on any genome for which a significant number of mRNA, EST, or protein sequences are available. Other features, such as clones, STS markers, and SNPs, can also be annotated whenever the relevant data are available for an organism.</p>
                <p>For example, genes and other features are placed on the mouse Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) assembly from the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus/credits.html">Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium</ext-link> (MGSC) by skipping the assembly steps used in the human process but following the annotation steps with relatively minor adjustments. A variation of the human process is also used to assemble and annotate genomic contigs from finished mouse clone sequences (see the Map Viewer <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/maps.cgi?ORG=mouse&amp;chr=1">display</ext-link> of the mouse genome).</p>
              </boxed-text>
              <p>The primary data produced by genome sequencing projects are often highly fragmented and sparsely annotated. This is especially true for the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.gov/page.cfm?pageID=10001772">Human Genome Project</ext-link> as a result of its policy of releasing sequence data to the public sequence databases every day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.1536">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.1537">2</xref>). So that individual researchers do not have to piece together extended segments of a genome and then relate the sequence to genetic maps and known genes, NCBI provides annotated assemblies of public genome sequence data. NCBI assimilates data of various types, from numerous sources, to provide an integrated view of a genome, making it easier for researchers to spot informative relationships that might not have been apparent from looking at the primary data. The annotated genomes can be explored using Map Viewer (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1562">Chapter 20</xref>) to display different types of data side-by-side and to follow links between related pieces of data.</p>
              <p>This chapter describes the series of steps, the &ldquo;pipeline&rdquo;, that produces NCBI's annotated genome assembly from data deposited in the public sequence databases. A variant of the annotation process developed for the human genome is used to annotate the mouse genome, and similar procedures will be applied to other genomes (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bid.1742">Box 1</xref>).</p>
              <p>NCBI constantly strives to improve the accuracy of its human genome assembly and annotation, to make the data displays more informative, and to enhance the utility of our access tools. Each run through the assembly and annotation procedure, together with feedback from outside groups and individual users, is used to improve the process, refine the parameters for individual steps, and add new features. Consequently, the details of the assembly and annotation process change from one run to the next. This chapter, therefore, describes the overall human genome assembly and annotation process and provides short descriptions of the key steps, but it does not detail specific procedures or parameters. However, sufficient detail is provided to enable users of our assembly and annotations to become familiar with the complexities and possible limitations of the data we provide.</p>

              <title>Overview of the Genome Assembly and Annotation Process</title>
              <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.1442">Figure 1</xref> shows how the main steps in the human genome assembly and annotation process are organized and also shows the most significant interdependencies between the steps. The pipeline is not linear, because whenever possible, steps are performed in parallel to reduce the overall time taken to produce an annotated assembly from a new set of data. Some of the steps are run incrementally on a timetable that is independent from that of the main pipeline to produce a new assembly more quickly.<fig id="bid.1442"><label>1</label><caption><title>The human genome assembly and annotation process.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch14f1" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>
              <sec id="bid.1443">
                <title>Data Freeze</title>
                <p>New sequence data that could be used to improve the genome assembly and annotation become available on a daily basis. Since the assembly and annotation process takes several weeks to complete, the data are &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; at the start of the build process by making a copy of all of the data available for use at that time. Freezing the data provides a stable set of inputs for the remainder of the build process. Additional or revised data that become available during the period taken to complete the process are not used until the next build.</p>

              <sec id="bid.1444">
                <title>The Build Cycle</title>
                <p>A build begins with a freeze of the input data and ends with the public release of an annotated assembly of genomic sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.1442">Figure 1</xref>). There are usually a few months between builds so that the latest build can be evaluated and improvements can be made.</p>

              <sec id="bid.1445">
                <title>Steps Run Incrementally</title>
                <p>The early steps of the genome assembly and annotation pipeline involve many computationally intensive processes, including masking the repetitive sequences and aligning each genomic sequence to the other genomic sequences, mRNAs, and Expressed Sequence Tags (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1283">EST</xref>s). Running these steps incrementally minimizes the time between starting a new build and being ready to start the assembly and annotation steps. Approximately once a week, independent from the build cycle, new or updated sequences that have been deposited in GenBank are retrieved for processing. Periodically, old versions of the sequences are purged from the set of accumulated data files.</p>
                <p>The manual refinement of the set of assembled genomic <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1267">contig</xref>s produced entirely from <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1292">finished</xref> sequence is another time-consuming step that is carried out incrementally, approximately once a week.</p>

              <sec id="bid.1446">
                <title>Steps Run Irregularly</title>
                <p>Because some data change infrequently, some relatively quick steps are executed on time frames that are not tied to the build cycle. For example, the list of special cases used to override the automatic process is updated whenever the need becomes apparent.</p>

                    <bold>Genomic Sequences Used for Assembly</bold>
                  </title>
                  <p>Genomic sequences from the following five data sets are processed for use in the assembly:</p>
                  <p><bold>High-Throughput Genomic Sequences.</bold> Human high-throughput genomic sequences (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1311">HTGS</xref>s) are retrieved using the <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1282">Entrez</xref> query system (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.588">Chapter 15</xref>). The query used returns sequences for all entries that contain the HTG keyword, regardless of whether the sequence is <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1292">finished</xref> or is in any of the unfinished <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1276">draft</xref> phases.</p>
                  <p><bold>Finished Chromosome Sequences.</bold> The center that coordinates the sequencing of a finished chromosome submits a specification regarding how to build the sequence of that chromosome from its component clone sequences to a <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cvsweb.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/genome-map/data/?cvsroot=Ensembl">data repository</ext-link> at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI). The sequences specified for any finished chromosomes are retrieved from GenBank and included in the set of genomic sequences to be processed for an assembly.</p>
                  <p><bold>Genomic Sequences from the Tiling Paths of Individual Chromosomes.</bold> The human genome sequencing centers use a variety of experimental evidence to compile an <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/chromReports/">ordered list</ext-link> of clones they believe provides the best coverage for each chromosome. At least once every 2 months, the sequencing centers submit an updated minimal tiling path for each chromosome to a <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cvs.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/genome-map/data/?cvsroot=Ensembl">data repository</ext-link> at the EBI. These tiling path files (TPFs) include Accession numbers if sequence for a clone is available. The tiling path repository is checked each day for the Accession numbers from any tiling path that has been updated. Any secondary Accession numbers are replaced with the corresponding primary Accession numbers, and any invalid Accession numbers are flagged to prevent those sequences from being used for assembly. The latest version of the sequence for each Accession number in the most recent clone tiling paths is retrieved from GenBank and included in the set of genomic sequences to be processed for assembly.</p>
                  <p><bold>Assembled Blocks of Contiguous Finished Genomic Sequence.</bold> As the sequences for individual clones are finished, they are merged with overlapping finished sequences to form contigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.1538">3</xref>). The primary source for identifying neighboring clones is the clone tiling path for each chromosome. Additional information is obtained from some GenBank entries that contain annotation specifying the neighboring clones. <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1246">BLAST</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.1539">4</xref>) is used to align the sequences of candidate pairs of clones, and a merged sequence is produced automatically if the expected overlap is confirmed by the sequence alignment. When the automatic processes do not find an expected overlap, there is a manual review to find the correct overlap, refining the clone order if necessary. The most recent set of finished contigs are processed for assembly.</p>
                  <p><bold>Additional Genomic Sequences.</bold> A few other specific human genomic sequences are added to the assembly set because they contain genes that may not be represented in the genomic sequences from the other sources.</p>

                  <p>Sequences known to come from both ends of the same cloned genomic fragment provide valuable linking information that helps to order and orient sequence contigs in the assembly step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.1540">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.1541">6</xref>). The <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://snp.cshl.org">SNP Consortium</ext-link> sequenced the ends of the inserts in several million plasmid clones containing small (0.8&ndash;6 Kbp) fragments of human genomic DNA. In many cases, both ends of the same insert were sequenced (Table 4 in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.1542">7</xref>), thereby providing a set of plasmid paired-end sequences.</p>

These Reference Sequences (RefSeqs) are aligned to the assembled genome so that the curated annotation can be transferred to the assembled genomic sequence. RefSeqs for known pseudogenes are also aligned, not only to enable transfer of the correct annotation but, more importantly, to prevent prediction of erroneous model transcripts and proteins.</p>
                  <p><bold>BAC End Sequences</bold>. Sequences from the ends of human genomic inserts in Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1243">BAC</xref>) clones are used to help map the location of specific clones onto the assembled genome sequence. The BAC end sequences are obtained from <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbGSS/">dbGSS</ext-link> (see         <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.2">Chapter 1</xref>). The clone names are extracted and converted to a <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/clone/nomenclature.shtml">standardized format</ext-link> to facilitate linking of the BAC end sequences with mapping data and additional sequences for the same clone, when these are available.</p>

Most genomic sequences deposited in GenBank by individual scientists will not be HTG and therefore will not be used for assembly; however, they are used for alignment. The exceptions are a few non-HTG sequences that are used for assembly, because they are included in the clone tiling path of an individual chromosome or in an assembled block of finished sequence. Any sequences intended for assembly but not used, either because they are redundant or are rejected by one of the quality screens in the assembly process, are also used for alignment.</p>

Tiling path draft sequences that are adjacent to and overlap the finished clone sequences or other draft clone sequences are added to extend the initial genomic sequence contigs. After that, genomic sequences from clones not on any chromosome tiling path are added, provided they have good overlaps with the assembled tiling path clones. Genomic sequences from additional clones may be added if they provide the sequence for a known gene that is missing from the existing genomic sequence contigs. Finally, the individual fragments of draft sequences are ordered and oriented.</p>
                  <p><bold>Assembly of Finished Sequences from Tiling Path Clones.</bold> The quality of any overlaps between finished clone sequences that are adjacent in the clone tiling path are assessed using the alignments between pairs of genomic sequences that were produced in advance. Sequences that have high-quality overlaps, or that are known from annotation or other data to abut, are merged to form a genomic sequence contig. Clone sequences that have no good overlaps are retained as separate contigs.</p>

An overlap involving a draft sequence can contain more mismatches, but must be longer, than an overlap between two finished sequences. Preference is given to finished sequences so that a contig made by merging finished and draft sequences will contain the finished sequence for the overlapping portion. Draft clone sequences that have no good overlaps are retained as separate contigs.</p>
                  <p><bold>Addition of Sequences from Other Genomic Clones.</bold> Genomic sequences from clones that are not on any chromosome tiling path are used to close, or extend into, gaps in the backbone of genomic contigs assembled based on the tiling paths. Genomic sequences that are fully contained within the existing genomic contigs are not used. Any remaining genomic sequences that were either assigned to the relevant chromosome or could not be assigned to any chromosome are evaluated, and sequences that have good-quality overlaps with genomic contigs are merged in to extend a contig or to join two adjacent contigs, if two additional conditions are met: (1) the gap must be sufficiently large to accommodate the additional sequence; and (2) the Sequence Tagged Site (STS) marker content of the additional clone sequence must be compatible with that of the flanking clone sequences when compared with various STS maps.</p>
                  <p>After all of the chromosomes have been assembled, any remaining genomic clone sequence that contains a known gene not present in the other contigs is added to the assembly as a separate contig.</p>
                  <p><bold>Ordering and Orienting Draft Sequence Fragments.</bold> The order and orientation of the fragments of HTGS_PHASE1 draft sequence need to be defined before sequence made from contigs that include this category of draft sequence can be completed. Some fragments may be ordered and oriented by overlaps with sequences from adjacent clones. Many more can be defined by aligning them with mRNAs, ESTs, or plasmid paired-end sequences. Any fragments whose order and orientation remain undefined are placed in the nearest open gap and given an arbitrary orientation. Fragments of draft sequence are connected to flanking sequences and to each other by runs of 100 unknown bases (Ns), which represent an arbitrarily sized gap in the sequence.</p>

Therefore, the order and orientation of most of the genomic sequence contigs are derived from the tiling paths.

                <p>The provisional assembly is checked for consistency with the chromosome tiling paths and various STS maps. The order in which the component clone sequences appear in the assembled chromosomes is compared with their order in the tiling paths on which the assembly was based. The STS marker order along each chromosome in the provisional assembly, as determined by e-PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.1548">13</xref>) using the UniSTS database, is checked for consistency with a set of STS maps. Haussler et al. at the University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC) also perform a set of independent quality checks on the provisional assembly. In addition to comparing the assembly to the chromosome tiling paths and to various STS maps, they also look for potentially misassembled contigs using alignments of BAC end sequences. Any serious errors in the assembly may be corrected by repeating the assembly steps using different parameters or by manually editing the assembly.</p>

                  <p>A candidate gene model is produced from each set of alignments between a particular transcript and one strand of a particular genomic contig as follows: (1) putative exons are identified by looking for mRNA splice sites near the ends of those alignments that satisfy minimum length and percentage identity criteria; (2) a mutually compatible set of exons for the model is selected by applying rules, such as restrictions on the size of an intron, that define plausible exon&ndash;intron structures; and (3) BLAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.1539">4</xref>) may be used to produce additional alignments to try to identify exons that were missed because they were too short to be represented in the initial set of transcript alignments. Candidate gene models are only retained if good-quality alignments between their exons and the defining transcript cover either more than half the length of the transcript or more than 1 Kbp.</p>

Hence, there should not be more than one gene model corresponding to any given RefSeq RNA. Therefore, all gene models based on a particular RefSeq RNA are compared, and the best one is selected. Because the RefSeq RNA is taken to be the best representation of a particular transcript, this gene model is preserved without any further modification. Any extra models may represent paralogs; therefore, they are included with the mRNA- and EST-based models for further processing. Between builds, RefSeq RNAs are refined based on a review of related gene models and transcript alignments produced during the genome annotation process.</p>

Significant alignments between translated genomic sequences and conserved protein domains are obtained in the same manner. A third set of alignments comes from running GenomeScan without any hints.

RefSeqs are produced in alternative formats so that they can be retrieved by Entrez, BLAST, or FTP.</p>

                <title>RefSeqs</title>
                <p>A fully annotated Refseq entry is made for each genomic sequence contig. Separate RefSeq model RNA and protein entries are also made for any of the transcripts and coding regions annotated on genomic contigs not identified as existing RefSeqs. Finally, a RefSeq entry is made for each chromosome by combining the annotated sequences of the genomic contigs in the appropriate order and with the appropriate spacing. The resulting RefSeqs can be retrieved through Entrez.</p>

                <p>The assembled genomic contig RefSeqs are formatted as a BLAST database (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.610">Chapter 16</xref>). Separate BLAST databases are also produced from the set of transcripts and the set of proteins annotated on the assembled genome. These databases include both known and model RefSeqs. In addition, separate BLAST databases are produced from the complete sets of transcripts and proteins predicted by GenomeScan.</p>

                <p>The annotated genomic sequence contig, model transcript, and model protein RefSeqs are saved in GenBank flatfile and ASN.1 formats. The same sets of sequences that are used to make BLAST databases are also saved in FASTA format. All of these data files, together with files that specify the construction of the genomic contigs and their arrangement along the chromosomes, are made available for download by <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/H_sapiens/">FTP</ext-link>.</p>

              <title>Production of Maps That Display Genome Features</title>
              <p>We produce many maps showing the locations of various features annotated on our genome assembly. Maps containing whatever combination of features that interests the user can be selected and displayed side-by-side using <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PMGifs/Genomes/MapViewerHelp.html">Map Viewer</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1562">Chapter 20</xref>). Detailed descriptions of the maps available for each genome are available in the relevant Genome Map Viewer <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PMGifs/Genomes/humansearch.html">help document</ext-link>.</p>

                <title>Preparation of Map Data</title>
                <p>Basic map data are prepared for each map to identify each feature, delineate its position on the chromosome, and specify how it is to be displayed. For many maps, supplemental data are prepared to provide more information about each feature. Map Viewer displays this map-specific supplemental information when users select a particular map as the Master Map (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1562">Chapter 20</xref>).</p>

                    <bold>Maps Based on Sequence Coordinates</bold>
                  </title>
                  <p>Maps that display those features annotated on the genomic sequence contigs (genes, STSs, clones, and SNPs) are generated by translating the positions of the features on the contigs into chromosome coordinates. Contig coordinates are translated into chromosome coordinates using the positions of the contigs along each chromosome, as determined in the genome assembly step. Using this same method, alignments between various sequences and the genomic contigs are translated into chromosome coordinates to produce additional maps that show the locations of the aligned sequences on the chromosomes. Maps generated from sequence alignments include maps that show the genomic positions of mRNA plus EST sequences, or genomic sequences from GenBank. The specifications used to build each genomic contig are also translated into chromosome coordinates to produce one map that shows the component sequences used to assemble each contig and another that simply shows the finished and draft sections of the contigs.</p>

                  <p>Cytogenetic maps, genetic linkage maps, and radiation hybrid maps use different coordinate systems that are not based on sequence. To generate data for these types of maps, the locations of the map elements are listed in the coordinate system appropriate to each map. Map Viewer can scale maps defined in different coordinate systems so that they can de displayed side by side.</p>

                <p>All of the map data for the new genome assembly are loaded into the Map Viewer database. Next, the objects in the new maps are indexed so that users can search for and then display specific features (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1562">Chapter 20</xref>).

              <title>Summary</title>
              <p>Entrez is the text-based search and retrieval system used at NCBI for all of the major databases, including PubMed, Nucleotide and Protein Sequences, Protein Structures, Complete Genomes, Taxonomy, OMIM, and many others. Entrez is at once an indexing and retrieval system, a collection of data from many sources, and an organizing principle for biomedical information. These general concepts are the focus of this chapter. Other chapters cover the details of a specific Entrez database (e.g., PubMed in <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.42">Chapter 2</xref>) or a specific source of data (e.g., GenBank in <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.2">Chapter 1</xref>).</p>

              <sec id="bid.590">
                <title>History</title>
                <p>The first version of Entrez was distributed by NCBI in 1991 on CD-ROM. At that time, it consisted of nucleotide sequences from GenBank and PDB; protein sequences from translated GenBank, PIR, SWISS-PROT, PDB, and PRF; and associated citations and abstracts from MEDLINE (now PubMed and referred to as PubMed below). We will use this first design to illustrate the principles behind Entrez.</p>

              <sec id="bid.591">
                <title>Entrez Nodes Represent Data</title>
                <p>An Entrez &ldquo;node&rdquo; is a collection of data that is grouped together and indexed together. It is usually referred to as an Entrez database. In the first version of Entrez, there were three nodes: published articles, nucleotide sequences, and protein sequences. Each node represents specific data objects of the same type, e.g., protein sequences, which are each given a unique ID (UID) within that logical Entrez Proteins node. Records in a node may come from a single source (e.g., all published articles are from PubMed) or many sources (e.g., proteins are from translated GenBank sequences, <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1412">SWISS-PROT</xref>, or <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1374">PIR</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.592">Figure 1</xref>).<fig id="bid.592"><label>1</label><caption><title>The original version of Entrez had just 3 nodes: nucleotides, proteins, and PubMed abstracts. Entrez has now grown to nearly 20 nodes.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch15f1" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>
                <p>Note that the UID identifies a single, well-defined object (i.e., a particular protein sequence or PubMed citation). There may be other information about objects in nodes, such as protein names or <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1280">EC number</xref>s, that may be used as index terms to find the record, but these pieces of information are not the central organizing principle of the node. Each data object represents a stable, objective observation of data as much as possible, rather than interpretations of the data, which are subject to change or confusion over time or across disciplines. For example, barring experimental error, a particular mRNA sequence report is not likely to change over the years; however, the given name, position on the chromosome, or function of the protein product may well change as our knowledge develops. Even a published article is a stable observation. The fact that the article was published at a certain time and contained certain words will not change over time, although the importance of the article topic may change many times.</p>

                <title>Entrez Nodes Are Intended for Linking</title>
                <p>Another criterion for selecting a particular data type to be an Entrez node is to enable linking to other Entrez nodes in a useful and reliable way. For example, given a protein sequence, it is very useful to quickly find the nucleotide sequence that encodes it. Or given a research article, it is useful to find the sequences it describes, if any.</p>

                  <title>
                    <bold>Links between Nodes</bold>
                  </title>
                  <p>One way to achieve this is to put all of the information into one record. For example, many GenBank records contain pertinent article citations. However, PubMed also contains the article abstract and additional index terms (e.g., MeSH terms); furthermore, the bibliographic information is also more carefully curated than the citation in a GenBank entry. It therefore makes much more sense to search for articles in PubMed rather than in GenBank.</p>
                  <p>When a subset of articles has been retrieved from PubMed, it may be useful to link to sequence information associated with the abstracts. The article citation in the GenBank record can be used to establish the link to PubMed and, conversely, to make the reciprocal link from the PubMed article back to the GenBank record. Treating each Entrez node separately but enabling linking between related data in different nodes means that the retrieval characteristics for each node can be optimized for the characteristics and strengths of that node, whereas related data can be reached in nodes with different strengths.</p>
                  <p>This approach also means that new connections between data can be made. In the example above, the GenBank record cited the published article, but there was no link from that article in PubMed to the sequence until Entrez made the reciprocal link from PubMed. Now, when searching articles in PubMed, it is possible to find this sequence, although no PubMed records have been changed. Because of this design principle, the Entrez system is richly interconnected, although any particular association may originate from only one record in one node.</p>

                  <title>
                    <bold>Links within Nodes</bold>
                  </title>
                  <p>Another type of linking in Entrez is between records of the same type, often called &ldquo;neighbors&rdquo;, in sequence and structure nodes. Most often these associations are computed at NCBI. For example, in Entrez Proteins, all of the protein sequences are &ldquo;<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1246">BLAST</xref>ed&rdquo; against each other, and the highest-scoring hits are stored as indexes within the node. This means that each protein record has associated with it a list of highly similar sequences, or neighbors.</p>
                  <p>Again, associations that may not be present in the original records can be made. For example, a well-annotated SWISS-PROT record for a particular protein may have fields that describe other protein or GenBank records from which it was derived. At a later date, a closely related protein may appear in GenBank that will not be referenced by the SWISS-PROT record. However, if a scientist finds an article in PubMed that has a link to the new GenBank record, that person can look at the protein and then use the BLAST-computed neighbors to find the SWISS-PROT record (as well as many others), although neither the SWISS-PROT record nor the new GenBank record refers to each other anywhere.</p>

                <title>Entrez Nodes Are Intended for Computation</title>
                <p>There are many advantages to establishing new associations by computational methods (as in the GenBank&ndash;SWISS-PROT example above), especially for large, rapidly changing data sets such as those in biomedicine.</p>
                <p>As computers get faster and cheaper, this type of association can be made more efficiently. As data sets get bigger, the problem remains tractable or may even improve because of better statistics. If a new algorithm or approach is found to be an improvement, it is possible to apply it over the whole data set within a practical timescale and by using a reasonable number of resources. Any associations that require human curation, such as the application of controlled vocabularies, do not scale well with rapidly growing sets of data or evolving data interpretations. Although these manual kinds of approaches certainly add value, computational approaches can often produce good results more objectively and efficiently.</p>

              <title>Entrez Is a Discovery System</title>
              <p>A data-retrieval system succeeds when you can retrieve the same data you put in. A discovery system is intended to let you find more information than appears in the original data. By making links between selected nodes and making computed associations within the same node, Entrez is designed to infer relationships between different data that may suggest future experiments or assist in interpretation of the available information, although it may come from different sources.</p>
              <p>The ability to compare genotype information across a huge range of organisms is a powerful tool for molecular biologists. For example, this technique was used in the discovery of a gene associated with hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC). The tumor cells from most familial cases of HNPCC had altered, short, repeated DNA sequences, suggesting that DNA replication errors had occurred during tumor development. This information caused a group of investigators to look for human homologs of the well-characterized <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DNA mismatch repair enzyme, MutS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.609">1</xref>). Mutants in a <italic>MutS</italic> homolog in yeast, <italic>MSH2</italic>, showed expansion and contraction of dinucleotide repeats similar to the mutation found in the human tumor cells. By comparing the protein sequences between the yeast MSH2, the <italic>E. coli</italic> MutS, and a human gene product isolated and cloned from HNPCC colorectal tumor, the researchers could show that the amino acid sequences of all three proteins were very similar. From this, they inferred that the human gene, which they called <italic>hMSH2</italic>, may also play a role in repairing DNA, and that the mutation found in tumors negatively affects this function, leading to tumor development.</p>
              <p>The researchers could connect the functional data about the yeast and bacterial genes with the genetic mapping and clinical phenotype information in humans. Entrez is designed to support this kind of process when the underlying data are available electronically. In PubMed, the research paper about the discovery of <italic>hMSH2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.609">1</xref>) has links to the protein sequence, which in turn has links to &ldquo;neighbors&rdquo; (related sequences). There are lots of records for this protein and its relatives in many organisms, but among them are the proteins from yeast and <italic>E. coli</italic> that prompted the study. From those records there are links back to the PubMed abstracts of articles that reported these proteins. PubMed also has a &ldquo;neighbor&rdquo; function, <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Related articles</named-content>, that represents other articles that contain words and phrases in common with the current record. Because phrases such as &ldquo;<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>&rdquo;, &ldquo;mismatch repair&rdquo;, and &ldquo;MutS&rdquo; all occur in the current article, many of the articles most related to this one describe studies on the <italic>E. coli</italic> mismatch repair system. These articles may not be directly linked to any sequence themselves and may not contain the words &ldquo;human&rdquo; or &ldquo;colon cancer&rdquo; but are relevant to HNPCC nonetheless, because of what the bacterial system may tell us.</p>

              <p>More nodes are planned for addition in the near future. Each one of these nodes is richly connected to others. Each offers unique information and unique new relationships among its members. The combination of new links and new relationships increases the chances for discovery. The addition of each new node creates different paths through the data that may lead to new connections, without more work on the old nodes.</p>

              <title>How Entrez Works</title>
              <p>Entrez integrates data from a large number of sources, formats, and databases into a uniform information model and retrieval system. The actual databases from which records are retrieved and on which the Entrez indexes are based have different designs, based on the type of data, and reside on different machines. These will be referred to as the &ldquo;source databases&rdquo;. A common theme in the implementation of Entrez is that some functions are unique to each source database, whereas others are common to all Entrez databases.</p>
              <sec id="bid.606">
                <title>A Division of Labor: Basic Principles</title>
                <p>Some of the common routines and formats for every Entrez node include the term lists and posting files (i.e., the retrieval engine) used for Boolean queries, the links within and between nodes, and the summary format used for listing search results in which each record is called a DocSum. Generally, an Entrez query is a <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1253">Boolean</xref> expression that is evaluated by the common Entrez engine and yields a list of unique ID numbers (UIDs), which identify records in an Entrez node. Given one or more UIDs, Entrez can retrieve the DocSum(s) very quickly. The links made within or between Entrez nodes from one or more UIDs is also a function across all Entrez source databases.</p>
                <p>The software that tracks the addition of new or updated records or identifies those that should be deleted from Entrez may be unique for each source database. Each database must also have accompanying software to gather index terms, DocSums, and links from the source data and present them to the common Entrez indexer. This can be achieved through either a set of C++ libraries or by generating an XML document in a specific DTD that contains the terms, DocSums, and links. Although the common engine retrieves a DocSum(s) given a UID(s), the retrieval of a full, formatted record is directed to the source database, where software unique to that database is used to format the record correctly. All of this software is written by the NCBI group that runs the database.</p>
                <p>This combination of database-specific software and a common set of Entrez routines and applications allows code sharing and common large-retrieval server administration but enables flexibility and simplicity for a wide variety of data sources.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="bid.607">
                <title>Software</title>
                <p>Although the basic principles of Entrez have remained the same for almost a decade, the software implementation has been through at least three major redesigns and many minor ones.</p>
                <p>Currently, Entrez is written using the NCBI C++ Toolkit. The indexing fields (which for PubMed, for example, would be Title, Author, Publication Date, Journal, Abstract, and so on) and DocSum fields (which for PubMed are Author, Title, Journal, Publication Date, Volume, and Page Number) for each node are defined in a configuration file; but for performance at runtime, the configuration files are used to automatically generate base classes for each database. These are the basic pieces of information used by Entrez that can also be inherited and used by more database-specific, hand-coded features. The term indexes are based on the Indexed Sequential-Access Method (ISAM) and are in large, shared, memory-mapped files. The postings are large bitmaps, with one bit per document in the node. Depending on how sparsely populated the posting is, the bit array is adaptively compressed on disk using one of four possible schemes. Boolean operations are performed by using AND or OR postings of bit arrays into a result bit array. DocSums are small, fielded data structures stored on the same machines as the postings to support rapid retrieval.</p>
                <p>The Web-based Entrez retrieval program, called <italic>query</italic>, is a fast cgi application that uses the Web application framework from the NCBI C++ Toolkit. One aspect of this framework is a set of classes that represents an HTML page. These classes allow the combination of static template pages, on the fly, with callbacks to class methods at tagged parts of the template. The Web page generated in an Entrez session contains elements from static templates and elements generated dynamically from common Entrez classes and from classes unique to one or a few Entrez nodes. Again, this design supports a common core of robust, common functionality maintained by one group, with support for customizations by diverse groups within NCBI.</p>
                <p>Boolean query processing, DocSum retrieval, and other common functions are supported on a number of load-balanced &ldquo;front-end&rdquo; UNIX machines. Because Entrez can support session context (for example, in the use of query history, NCBI Cubby, Filters, etc.), a &ldquo;history server&rdquo; has been implemented on the front-end machines so that if a user is sent to machine &ldquo;A&rdquo; by the load balancer for their first query but to machine &ldquo;B&rdquo; for the second query, Entrez can quickly locate the user's query history and obtain it from machine &ldquo;A&rdquo;. Other than that, the front-end machines are completely independent of each other and can be added and removed readily from <italic>query</italic> support. Retrieval of full documents comes from a variety of &ldquo;back-end&rdquo; databases, depending on the node. These might be Sybase or Microsoft SQL Server relational databases of a variety of schemas or text files of various formats. Links are supported using the Sybase IQ database product.</p>

              <title>Summary</title>
              <p>The comparison of nucleotide or protein sequences from the same or different organisms is a very powerful tool in molecular biology. By finding similarities between sequences, scientists can infer the function of newly sequenced genes, predict new members of gene families, and explore evolutionary relationships. Now that whole genomes are being sequenced, sequence similarity searching can be used to predict the location and function of protein-coding and transcription-regulation regions in genomic DNA.</p>
              <p>Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.648">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.649">2</xref>) is the tool most frequently used for calculating sequence similarity. BLAST comes in variations for use with different query sequences against different databases. All BLAST applications, as well as information on which BLAST program to use and other help documentation, are listed on the BLAST <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/">homepage</ext-link>. This chapter will focus more on how BLAST works, its output, and how both the output and program itself can be further manipulated or customized, rather than on how to use <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Education/BLASTinfo/information3.html">BLAST</ext-link> or interpret BLAST results.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The way most people use BLAST is to input a nucleotide or protein sequence as a query against all (or a subset of) the public sequence databases, pasting the sequence into the textbox on one of the BLAST <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/">Web pages</ext-link>. This sends the query over the Internet, the search is performed on the NCBI databases and servers, and the results are posted back to the person's browser in the chosen display format. However, many biotech companies, genome scientists, and bioinformatics personnel may want to use &ldquo;stand-alone&rdquo; BLAST to query their own, local databases or want to customize BLAST in some way to make it better suit their needs. Stand-alone BLAST comes in two forms: the executables that can be run from the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/blast_overview.html#executables">command line</ext-link>; or the Standalone WWW <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/blast_overview.html#wwwserver">BLAST Server</ext-link>, which allows users to set up their own in-house versions of the BLAST Web pages.</p>
              <p>There are many different <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/html/BLASThomehelp.html">variations</ext-link> of BLAST available to use for different sequence comparisons, e.g., a DNA query to a DNA database, a protein query to a protein database, and a DNA query, translated in all six reading frames, to a protein sequence database. Other <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/producttable.html">adaptations</ext-link> of BLAST, such as PSI-BLAST (for iterative protein sequence similarity searches using a position-specific score matrix) and RPS-BLAST (for searching for protein domains in the Conserved Domains Database, <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.94">Chapter 3</xref>) perform comparisons against sequence profiles.</p>
              <p>This chapter will first describe the BLAST architecture&mdash;how it works at the NCBI site&mdash;and then go on to describe the various BLAST outputs. The best known of these outputs is the default display from BLAST Web pages, the so-called &ldquo;traditional report&rdquo;. As well as obtaining BLAST results in the traditional report, results can also be delivered in structured output, such as a hit table (see below), XML, or ASN.1. The optimal choice of output format depends upon the application. The final part of the chapter discusses stand-alone BLAST and describes possibilities for customization. There are many interfaces to BLAST that are often not exploited by users but can lead to more efficient and robust applications.</p>

            <sec id="bid.612">
              <title>How BLAST Works: The Basics</title>
              <p>The BLAST algorithm is a heuristic program, which means that it relies on some smart shortcuts to perform the search faster. BLAST performs &ldquo;local&rdquo; alignments. Most proteins are modular in nature, with functional domains often being repeated within the same protein as well as across different proteins from different species. The BLAST algorithm is tuned to find these domains or shorter stretches of sequence similarity. The local alignment approach also means that a mRNA can be aligned with a piece of genomic DNA, as is frequently required in genome assembly and analysis. If instead BLAST started out by attempting to align two sequences over their entire lengths (known as a global alignment), fewer similarities would be detected, especially with respect to domains and motifs.</p>
              <p>When a query is submitted via one of the BLAST Web pages, the sequence, plus any other input information such as the database to be searched, word size, expect value, and so on, are fed to the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Education/BLASTinfo/BLAST_algorithm.html">algorithm</ext-link> on the BLAST server. BLAST works by first making a look-up table of all the &ldquo;words&rdquo; (short subsequences, which for proteins the default is three letters) and &ldquo;neighboring words&rdquo;, i.e., similar words in the query sequence. The sequence database is then scanned for these &ldquo;hot spots&rdquo;. When a match is identified, it is used to initiate <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1296">gap</xref>-free and gapped extensions of the &ldquo;word&rdquo;.</p>
              <p>BLAST does not search GenBank flatfiles (or any subset of GenBank flatfiles) directly. Rather, sequences are made into BLAST databases. Each entry is split, and two files are formed, one containing just the header information and one containing just the sequence information. These are the data that the algorithm uses. If BLAST is to be run in &ldquo;stand-alone&rdquo; mode, the data file could consist of local, private data, downloaded NCBI BLAST databases, or a combination of the two.</p>
              <p>After the algorithm has looked up all possible &ldquo;words&rdquo; from the query sequence and extended them maximally, it assembles the best alignment for each query&ndash;sequence pair and writes this information to an SeqAlign data structure (in <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1242">ASN.1</xref> ; also used by Sequin, see <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.538">Chapter 12</xref>). The SeqAlign structure in itself does not contain the sequence information; rather, it refers to the sequences in the BLAST database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.613">Figure 1</xref>).<fig id="bid.613"><label>1</label><caption><title>How the BLAST results Web pages are assembled.</title><p>The QBLAST system located on the BLAST server executes the search, writing information about the sequence alignment in ASN.1. The results can then be formatted by fetching the ASN.1 (<italic>fetch ASN.1</italic>) and fetching the sequences (<italic>fetch sequence</italic>) from the BLAST databases. Because the execution of the search algorithm is decoupled from the formatting, the results can be delivered in a variety of formats without re-running the search.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch16f1" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>
              <p>The BLAST Formatter, which sits on the BLAST server, can use the information in the SeqAlign to retrieve the similar sequences found and display them in a variety of ways. Thus, once a query has been completed, the results can be reformatted without having to re-execute the search. This is possible because of the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/blast_overview.html#blastq">QBLAST</ext-link> system.</p>

            <sec id="bid.614">
              <title>BLAST Scores and Statistics</title>
              <p>Once BLAST has found a similar sequence to the query in the database, it is helpful to have some idea of whether the alignment is &ldquo;good&rdquo; and whether it portrays a possible biological relationship, or whether the similarity observed is attributable to chance alone. BLAST uses <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/tutorial/Altschul-1.html">statistical theory</ext-link> to produce a <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1245">bit score</xref> and expect value (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1279">E-value</xref>) for each alignment pair (query to hit).</p>
              <p>The bit score gives an indication of how good the alignment is; the higher the score, the better the alignment. In general terms, this score is calculated from a formula that takes into account the alignment of similar or identical residues, as well as any gaps introduced to align the sequences. A key element in this calculation is the &ldquo;<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1411">substitution matrix</xref> &rdquo;, which assigns a score for aligning any possible pair of residues. The <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1252">BLOSUM62</xref> matrix is the default for most BLAST programs, the exceptions being blastn and MegaBLAST (programs that perform nucleotide&ndash;nucleotide comparisons and hence do not use protein-specific matrices). Bit scores are normalized, which means that the bit scores from different alignments can be compared, even if different scoring matrices have been used.</p>
              <p>The E-value gives an indication of the statistical significance of a given pairwise alignment and reflects the size of the database and the scoring system used. The lower the E-value, the more significant the hit. A sequence alignment that has an E-value of 0.05 means that this similarity has a 5 in 100 (1 in 20) chance of occurring by chance alone. Although a statistician might consider this to be significant, it still may not represent a biologically meaningful result, and analysis of the alignments (see below) is required to determine &ldquo;biological&rdquo; significance.</p>

              <title>BLAST Output: 1. The Traditional Report</title>
              <p>Most BLAST users are familiar with the so-called &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; BLAST report. The report consists of three major sections: (1) the header, which contains information about the query sequence, the database searched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.616">Figure 2</xref>). On the Web, there is also a graphical overview (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.617">Figure 3</xref>); (2) the one-line descriptions of each database sequence found to match the query sequence; these provide a quick overview for browsing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.618">Figure 4</xref>); (3) the alignments for each database sequence matched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.619">Figure 5</xref>) (there may be more than one alignment for a database sequence it matches).<fig id="bid.616"><label>2</label><caption><title>The BLAST report header.</title><p>The <italic>top line</italic> gives information about the type of program (in this case, <italic>BLASTP</italic>), the version (<italic>2.2.1</italic>), and a version release date. The research paper that describes BLAST is then cited, followed by the request ID (issued by QBLAST), the query sequence <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1273">definition line</xref>, and a summary of the database searched. The <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Taxonomy reports</named-content> link displays this BLAST result on the basis of information in the Taxonomy database (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.246">Chapter 4</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch16f2" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig><fig id="bid.617"><label>3</label><caption><title>Graphical overview of BLAST results.</title><p>The query sequence is represented by the <italic>numbered red bar</italic> at the <italic>top</italic> of the figure. Database hits are shown aligned to the query, <italic>below</italic> the red bar. Of the aligned sequences, the most similar are shown closest to the query. In this case, there are three high-scoring database matches that align to most of the query sequence. The next twelve bars represent lower-scoring matches that align to two regions of the query, from about residues 3&ndash;60 and residues 220&ndash;500. The <italic>cross-hatched parts</italic> of the these bars indicate that the two regions of similarity are on the same protein, but that this intervening region does not match. The remaining bars show lower-scoring alignments. Mousing over the bars displays the definition line for that sequence to be shown in the window above the graphic.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch16f3" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig><fig id="bid.618"><label>4</label><caption><title>One-line descriptions in the BLAST report.</title><p>Each line is composed of four fields: (<italic>a</italic>) the gi number, database designation, Accession number, and locus name for the matched sequence, separated by vertical bars (Appendix 1); (<italic>b</italic>) a brief textual description of the sequence, the definition. This usually includes information on the organism from which the sequence was derived, the type of sequence (e.g., mRNA or DNA), and some information about function or phenotype. The definition line is often truncated in the one-line descriptions to keep the display compact; (<italic>c</italic>) the alignment score in bits. Higher scoring hits are found at the top of the list; and (<italic>d</italic>) the E-value, which provides an estimate of statistical significance. For the first hit in the list, the gi number is <italic>116365</italic>, the database designation is <italic>sp</italic> (for SWISS-PROT), the Accession number is <italic>P26374</italic>, the locus name is <italic>RAE2_HUMAN</italic>, the definition line is <italic>Rab proteins</italic>, the score is <italic>1216</italic>, and the E-value is <italic>0.0</italic>. Note that the first 17 hits have very low E-values (much less than 1) and are either RAB proteins or GDP dissociation inhibitors. The other database matches have much higher E-values, 0.5 and above, which means that these sequences may have been matched by chance alone.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch16f4" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig><fig id="bid.619"><label>5</label><caption><title>A pairwise sequence alignment from a BLAST report.</title><p>The alignment is preceded by the sequence identifier, the full definition line, and the length of the matched sequence, in amino acids.

The following line contains information on the number of identical residues in this alignment (<italic>Identities</italic>), the number of conservative substitutions (<italic>Positives</italic>), and if applicable, the number of gaps in the alignment. Finally, the actual alignment is shown, with the query on <italic>top</italic>, and the database match is labeled as <italic>Sbjct</italic>, below. The numbers at <italic>left</italic> and <italic>right</italic> refer to the position in the amino acid sequence. One or more dashes (&ndash;) within a sequence indicate insertions or deletions. Amino acid residues in the query sequence that have been masked because of low complexity are replaced by Xs (see, for example, the <italic>fourth</italic> and <italic>last</italic> blocks). The line between the two sequences indicates the similarities between the sequences. If the query and the subject have the same amino acid at a given location, the residue itself is shown. Conservative substitutions, as judged by the substitution matrix, are indicated with +.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch16f5" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>
              <p>The traditional report is really designed for human readability, as opposed to being parsed by a program. For example, the one-line descriptions are useful for people to get a quick overview of their search results, but they are rarely complete descriptors because of limited space. Also, for convenience, there are several pieces of information that are displayed in both the one-line descriptions and alignments (for example, the E-values, scores, and descriptions); therefore, the person viewing the search output does not need to move back and forth between sections.</p>
              <p>New features may be added to the report, e.g., the addition of links to LocusLink records (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.788">Chapter 19</xref>) from sequence hits, which result in a change of output format. These are easy for people to pick up on and take advantage of but can trip programs that parse this BLAST output.</p>
              <p>By default, a maximum of 500 sequence matches are displayed, which can be changed on the advanced BLAST page with the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Alignments</named-content> option. Many components of the BLAST results display via the Internet and are hyperlinked to the same information at different places in the page, to additional information including help documentation, and to the Entrez sequence records of matched sequences. These records provide more information about the sequence, including links to relevant research abstracts in PubMed.</p>

              <title>BLAST Output: 2. The Hit Table</title>
              <p>Although the traditional report is ideal for investigating the characteristics of one gene or protein, often scientists want to make a large number of BLAST runs for a specialized purpose and need only a subset of the information contained in the traditional BLAST report. Furthermore, in cases where the BLAST output will be processed further, it can be unreliable to parse the traditional report. The traditional report is merely a display format with no formal structure or rules, and improvements may be made at any time, changing the underlying <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1312">HTML</xref>. The hit table format provides a simple and clean alternative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.621">Figure 6</xref>).<fig id="bid.621"><label>6</label><caption><title>BLAST output in hit table format.</title><p>This shows the results of a search of an <italic>E. coli</italic> database using a human sequence as a query. The lines starting with a # sign should be considered comments and ignored. The <italic>last comment line</italic> lists the fields in the table.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch16f6" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>
              <p>The screening of many newly sequenced human Expressed Sequence Tags (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1283">EST</xref>s) for contamination by the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cloning vector is a good example of when it is preferable to use the hit table output over the traditional report. In this case, a strict, high E-value threshold would be applied to differentiate between contaminating <italic>E. coli</italic> sequence and the human sequence. Those human ESTs that find very strong, near-exact <italic>E.coli</italic> sequence matches can be discarded without further examination. (Borderline cases may require further examination by a scientist.)</p>
              <p>For these purposes, the hit table output is more useful than the traditional report; it contains only the information required in a more formal structure. The hit table output contains no sequences or definition lines, but for each sequence matched, it lists the sequence identifier, the start and stop points for stretches of sequence similarity (offset by one residue), the percent identity of the match, and the E-value.</p>

              <title>BLAST Output: 3. Structured Output</title>
              <p>There are drawbacks to parsing both the BLAST report and even the simpler hit table. There is no way to automatically check for truncated or otherwise corrupted output in cases when a large number of sequences are being screened. (This may happen if the disk is full, for example.) Also, there is no rigorous check for syntax changes in the output, such as the addition of new features, which can lead to erroneous parsing. Structured output allows for automatic and rigorous checks for syntax errors and changes. Both <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1435">XML</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1242">ASN.1</xref> are examples of structured output in which there are built-in checks for correct and complete syntax and structure. (In the case of XML, for example, this is ensured by the necessity for matching tags and the DTD.) For text reports, there is often no specification, but perhaps a (incomplete) description of the file is written afterward.</p>

                <p>As well as the hit table and traditional report shown in HTML, BLAST results can also be formatted in plain text, XML, and ASN.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.624">Figure 7</xref>), and what's more, the format for a given BLAST result can be changed without re-executing the search.<fig id="bid.624"><label>7</label><caption><title>The different output formats that can be produced from ASN.1.</title><p>Note that some nodes can be viewed as both HTML and text.

                <p>A change in BLAST format without re-executing the search is possible because when a scientist looks at a Web page of BLAST results at NCBI, the HTML that makes that page has been created from ASN.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.624">Figure 7</xref>). Although the formatted results are requested from the server, the information about the alignments is fetched from a disk in ASN.1, as are the corresponding sequences from the BLAST databases (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.613">Figure 1</xref>). The formatter on the BLAST server then puts these results together as a BLAST report. The BLAST search itself has been uncoupled from the way the result is formatted, thus allowing different output formats from the same search. The strict internal validation of ASN.1 ensures that these output formats can always be produced reliably.</p>

                <title>Information about the Alignment Is Contained within a SeqAlign</title>
                <p>SeqAlign is the ASN.1 object that contains the alignment information about the BLAST search. The SeqAlign does not contain the actual sequence that was found in the match but does contain the start, stop, and gap information, as well as scores, E-values, sequence identifiers, and (DNA) strand information.</p>
                <p>As mentioned above, the actual database sequences are fetched from the BLAST databases when needed. This means that an identifier must uniquely identify a sequence in the database. Furthermore, the query sequence cannot have the same identifier as any sequence in the database unless the query sequence itself is in the database. If one is using stand-alone BLAST with a custom database, it is possible to specify that every sequence is uniquely identified by using the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">&ndash;O</named-content> option with formatdb (the program that converts FASTA files to BLAST database format). This also indexes the entries by identifier. Similarly, the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">&ndash;J</named-content> option in the (stand-alone) programs blastall, blastpgp, megablast, or rpsblast certifies that the query does not use an identifier already in the database for a different sequence. If the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">&ndash;O</named-content> and <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">&ndash;J</named-content> options are not used, BLAST assigns unique identifiers (for that run) to all sequences and shields the user from this knowledge.</p>
                <p>Any BLAST database or FASTA file from the NCBI Web site that contains gi numbers already satisfies the uniqueness criterion. Unique identifiers are normally a problem only when custom databases are produced and care is not taken in assigning identifiers. The identifier for a FASTA entry is the first token (meaning the letters up to the first space) after the &gt; sign on the definition line. The simplest case is to simply have a unique token (e.g., 1, 2, and so on), but it is possible to construct more complicated identifiers that might, for example, describe the data source. For the FASTA identifiers to be reliably parsed, it is necessary for them to follow a specific syntax (see Appendix 1).</p>

                <title>XML</title>
                <p>XML and ASN.1 are both structured languages and can express the same information; therefore, it is possible to produce a SeqAlign in XML. Some users do not find the format of the information in the SeqAlign to be convenient because it does not contain actual sequence information, and when the sequence is fetched from the BLAST database, it is packed two or four bases per byte. Typically, these users are familiar with the BLAST report and want something similar but in a format that can be parsed reliably. The XML produced by BLAST meets this need, containing the query and database sequences, sequence definition lines, the start and stop points of the alignments (one offset), as well as scores, E-values, and percent identity. There is a public <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/documents/NCBI_BlastOutput.mod">DTD</ext-link> for this XML output.</p>

              <title>BLAST Code</title>
              <p>The BLAST code is part of the NCBI Toolkit, which has many low-level functions to make it platform independent; the Toolkit is supported under Linux and many varieties of UNIX, NT, and MacOS. To use the Toolkit, developers should write a function &ldquo;Main&rdquo;, which is called by the Toolkit &ldquo;main&rdquo;. The BLAST code is contained mostly in the tools directory (see Appendix 2 for an example).</p>
              <p>The BLAST code has a modular design. For example, the Application Programming Interface (API) for retrieval from the BLAST databases is independent of the compute engine. The compute engine is independent from the formatter; therefore, it is possible (as mentioned above) to compute results once but view them in many different modes.</p>

                <title>Readdb API</title>
                <p>The readdb API can be used to easily extract information from the BLAST databases. Among the data available are the date the database was produced, the title, the number of letters, number of sequences, and the longest sequence. Also available are the sequence and description of any entry. The latest version of the BLAST databases also contains a taxid (an integer specifying some node of the NCBI taxonomy tree; see <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.246">Chapter 4</xref>). Users are strongly encouraged to use the readdb API rather than reading the files associated with the database, because the the files are subject to change. The API, on the other hand, will support the newest version, and an attempt will be made to support older versions. See Appendix 2 for an example of a simple program (db2fasta.c) that demonstrates the use of the readdb API.</p>

              <p>The syntax of the FASTA definition lines used in the NCBI BLAST databases depends upon the database from which each sequence was obtained (see <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.2">Chapter 1</xref> on GenBank). <xref ref-type="table" rid="bid.632">Table 1</xref> shows how the sequence source databases are identified.</p>
              <p>For example, if the identifier of a sequence in a BLAST result is gb|M73307|AGMA13GT, the gb tag indicates that sequence is from GenBank, M73307 is the GenBank Accession number, and AGMA13GT is the GenBank locus.</p>
              <p>The bar (|) separates different fields. In some cases, a field is left empty, although the original specification called for including this field. To make these identifiers backwards-compatible for older parsers, the empty field is denoted by an additional bar (||).</p>
              <p>A gi identifier has been assigned to each sequence in NCBI's sequence databases. If the sequence is from an NCBI database, then the gi number appears at the beginning of the identifier in a traditional report. For example, gi|16760827|ref|NP_456444.1 indicates an NCBI reference sequence with the gi number 16760827 and Accession number NP_456444.1. (In stand-alone BLAST, or when running BLAST from the command line, the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">&ndash;I</named-content> option should be used to display the gi number.)</p>
              <p>The reason for adding the gi identifier is to provide a uniform, stable naming convention. If a nucleotide or protein sequence changes (for example, if it is edited by the original submitter of the sequence), a new gi identifier is assigned, but the Accession number of the record remains unchanged. Thus, the gi identifier provides a mechanism for identifying the exact sequence that was used or retrieved in a given search. This is also useful when creating crosslinks between different Entrez databases (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.588">Chapter 15</xref>).</p>

              <title>Summary</title>
              <p>The power of linking is one of the most important developments that the World Wide Web offers to the scientific and research community. By providing a convenient and effective means for sharing ideas, linking helps scientists and scholars promote their research goals.</p>
              <p><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/linkout/">LinkOut</ext-link> is a powerful linking feature of the Entrez search and retrieval system (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.588">Chapter 15</xref>). It is designed to provide Entrez users with links from database records to a wide variety of relevant online resources, including full-text publications, biological databases, consumer health information, and research tools. (See <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/linkout/doc/linksexample.html">Sample Links</ext-link> for examples of LinkOut resources.) The goal of LinkOut is to facilitate access to relevant online resources beyond the Entrez system to extend, clarify, or supplement information found in the Entrez databases. By branching out to relevant resources on the Web, LinkOut expands on the theme of Entrez as an information discovery system.</p>

              <title>How Is LinkOut Represented in Entrez?</title>
              <p>Any Entrez database record, e.g., a nucleotide sequence, a taxonomic record, a protein structure, or a PubMed abstract, can be linked to Web resources external to NCBI via LinkOut. The <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/linkout/">LinkOut homepage</ext-link> contains up-to-date documentation about LinkOut. The page that lists LinkOut resources associated with a given record can be accessed in a variety of ways (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.652">1</xref>&ndash;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.654">3</xref>). In the case of PubMed, the full-text article and other resources related to the abstract being viewed may be accessed directly by icon buttons above the abstract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.653">Figure 2</xref>). The LinkOut display can be customized by using the LinkOut <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/help/pmhelp.html#LinkOutPreferences">preferences</ext-link> in the <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1270">Cubby</xref>.<fig id="bid.652"><label>1</label><caption><title>The <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">LinkOut</named-content> display can be accessed by selecting <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">LinkOut</named-content> from a PubMed record (<italic>top panel</italic>), from other Entrez databases (<italic>middle panel</italic>), or from the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Display</named-content> list (<italic>lower panel</italic>).</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch17f1a" mime-subtype="gif"/><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch17f1b" mime-subtype="gif"/><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch17f1c" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig><fig id="bid.653"><label>2</label><caption><title>From PubMed, the links to the full text of research articles are also managed by LinkOut and can be accessed through an icon from PubMed Abstracts, highlighted here in <italic>purple</italic>, as well as from the associated list of LinkOut resources in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.654">Figure 3</xref>.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch17f2" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig><fig id="bid.654"><label>3</label><caption><title>Links to external resources are listed in the LinkOut <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Display</named-content> of an Entrez record.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch17f3" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>

              <title>How Does LinkOut Work?</title>
              <sec id="bid.656">
                <title>Design Overview</title>
                <p>The URLs to LinkOut resources are all provided by the person or organization that owns or created the resource. Links can be provided in any URL syntax, and providers of links may choose as much or as little access to their resource as they wish. Providers use one format to submit links to all Entrez databases.</p>
                <p>LinkOut is in itself an Entrez database that holds all the linking information to external resources. The separation of the data records (e.g., PubMed abstracts) from the external linking information (e.g., URLs to journal articles on a publisher's Web site) enables both the external link providers and NCBI to manage linking in a flexible manner. This means that if links to external resources change, such as in the case of a Web site redesign, this will not affect the Entrez database records, and linking information can be updated as frequently as necessary.</p>
                <p>The LinkOut database contains information on the relationship between a link and all of the applicable unique Entrez ID numbers (UIDs). By taking advantage of the interconnectivity among Entrez nodes, the linking information is presented seamlessly and efficiently.</p>

                    <p><bold>LinkSet</bold>: the root element of the resource file.</p>
                    <p><bold>Link</bold>: an element that describes a specific set of resources grouped together by access characteristics or for convenience. A resource file may have multiple Link elements.</p>
                    <p><bold>LinkId</bold>: an identifier assigned by the provider for its own reference. It may be any character string. Each Link should have a unique LinkId within each LinkSet or file.</p>
                    <p><bold>ProviderId</bold>: the identifier number assigned to the provider by NCBI and listed in the providerinfo.xml file.</p>
                    <p><bold>IconUrl</bold>: the URL to the icon that will be displayed on the PubMed Citation and Abstract Displays.</p>
                    <p><bold>ObjectSelector</bold>: an element containing sub-elements in which providers will specify which Entrez records are being linked from by a &lt;Link&gt; element.</p>
                    <p><bold>Database</bold>: a sub-element of &lt;ObjectSelector&gt;. Databases available for linking include: PubMed, Protein, Nucleotide, Genome, Structure, PopSet, Taxonomy, and OMIM.</p>
                    <p><bold>ObjectList</bold>: a sub-element of &lt;ObjectSelector&gt; containing either the &lt;Query&gt; or &lt;ObjectID&gt; that specifies the Entrez records from which the resource will be linked.</p>
                    <p><bold>Query</bold>: a sub-element of &lt;ObjectList&gt; that contains any valid Entrez search, used to select the Entrez records being linked from.</p>
                    <p><bold>ObjId</bold>: a sub-element of &lt;ObjectList&gt; that contains an Entrez record unique identifier (UID).</p>
                    <p><bold>ObjUrl</bold>: an element that contains the necessary information for the Entrez system to construct URLs to link to the provider's resources.</p>
                    <p><bold>Base</bold>: a sub-element of &lt;ObjUrl&gt; that is the base of the URL for the provider's records.</p>
                    <p><bold>Rule</bold>: a sub-element of &lt;ObjUrl&gt; that specifies the construction of the remainder of the URL, based upon the specification of systems where the resources reside.</p>
                    <p><bold>UrlName</bold>: a short (two- or three-word) description of the link. This may be used when multiple links are available for a single Entrez record. This may also be used if the allowed terms in SubjectType and Attribute cannot meet the need of a provider.</p>
                    <p><bold>SubjectType, Attribute</bold>: sub-elements of &lt;ObjectUrl&gt;, used to describe the subject(s) of the provider's resources, barriers (if any) to using the resources, and relationship of the provider to the resources listed in the resource file. The SubjectType(s) and Attribute(s) will be applied to the resources provided within a &lt;Link&gt;.</p>

                </boxed-text>
                <p>LinkOut information is submitted in XML, defined by the LinkOut Document Type Definition (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/linkout/doc/LinkOut.dtd">DTD</ext-link>).</p>
                <p>Linking information is supplied in two elements: the Provider element, which specifies information about a link provider; and the LinkSet element, which describes information about the link. Each element should be submitted to NCBI in a separate file. Identity files contain the Provider element, and Resource files contain the LinkSet element.</p>
                <p>The Identity file is always called providerinfo.xml. It describes the identity of a provider, including an ID (ProviderId) and an abbreviated name (NameAbbr) assigned by NCBI, the provider's name, and other general information about the provider. There should be only one providerinfo.xml file for each provider (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bid.658">Box 1</xref> for an example of an Identity file).</p>
                <p>The Resource file, which contains the LinkSet information, specifies a set of Entrez records with a valid Entrez query, a specific rule to build the link to an external resource, and description of the resource using the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/linkout/doc/subjecttypes.html">SubjectType, Attribute, and UrlName</ext-link> fields. There is no standard for naming the LinkSet files, except that they must use the .xml extension. There may be any number of LinkSet files associated with a ProviderId. (See <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bid.660">Box 2</xref> for an example of a Resource file.)</p>
                <p>Terms used in SubjectType and Attribute elements are controlled to describe LinkOut resources in a systematic manner. This is because resources are presented to users by SubjectType on the LinkOut display page (and within the Cubby system), making it easier to browse and access available resources. Attributes can be used to describe the nature of a LinkOut resource (i.e., whether the resource requires a subscription or registration to access the content). A short text string may be used in the UrlName element to describe a resource. UrlName is typically used when the allowed SubjectType and Attribute terms cannot describe the resource adequately or when multiple links are available from one provider for a single Entrez record.</p>

                <title>XML File Processing and Indexing</title>
                <p>All links from Entrez are generated on a daily basis so that new or modified Entrez records will have accurate LinkOut resources connected to them. Once a day, all LinkOut files are parsed according to the LinkOut DTD, and the LinkOut database is rebuilt, relating the Entrez UIDs with the link information specified in the LinkSet XML files.</p>
                <p>A LinkOut record consists of a link and the associated information, including its URL and all descriptive terms (SubjectType, Attribute, and UrlName) pertaining to the link. The Entrez UIDs applicable to the link are indexed to associate this information to the corresponding Entrez databases. As explained in <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.588">Chapter 15</xref>, LinkOut information is interconnected with all related Entrez records.</p>

                <title>LinkOut Filters</title>
                <p>To facilitate search and retrieval of LinkOut resources, there are a number of filters in the LinkOut-enabled Entrez databases. These filters, although not part of the LinkOut database, use the result generated in the LinkOut indexing process.</p>
                <p>The filters are all prefixed with <bold>lo</bold>. Filters are available for all allowable SubjectType and Attribute terms and the NameAbbr of a provider. Some examples include:
                  <list list-type="bullet">
                    <list-item id="bid.664">
                      <p><bold>loprov</bold>  LinkOut Provider</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item id="bid.665">
                      <p><bold>loattr</bold>  LinkOut Attribute</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item id="bid.666">
                      <p><bold>losubj</bold>  LinkOut SubjectType</p>
                    </list-item>
                    <list-item id="bid.667">
                      <p><bold>loall</bold>  all LinkOut resources in an Entrez database</p>
                    </list-item>
                  </list>
                </p>
                <p>To use these filters to retrieve a set of Entrez records with LinkOut resources, the filter term can be entered as a search. For example, in PubMed, searching <preformat>&ldquo;loattrfull text online&rdquo;[Filter]</preformat> will retrieve all records with LinkOut resources that have an attribute &ldquo;full-text online&rdquo;. The <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Preview/Index</named-content> section in PubMed can also be used to select LinkOut filters by first selecting <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Filter</named-content> and then typing in &ldquo;lo&rdquo; and selecting <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Index</named-content> to browse through all of the filters related to LinkOut.</p>

              <title>Guides for LinkOut Providers</title>
              <p>LinkOut resources should be directly relevant to specific subjects of the Entrez records to which they will be linked, thus providing further research resources for Entrez users. The information and its delivery system should be of high quality and must not, through typographic or factual errors, omissions, or other flaws or inconsistencies, mislead, hinder, or frustrate the research efforts of Entrez users. The resources should be easy to use and navigate. Resources from professional societies, government agencies, educational institutions, or individuals and organizations that have received grants from major funding organizations are preferred.</p>
              <p>Participation in LinkOut is voluntary. Providers need to submit two types of files to describe the LinkOut resources, Identity files and Resource files (see Boxes <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bid.658">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bid.660">2</xref>). These files include the necessary information for the Entrez system to construct an appropriate URL to access specific resources.</p>

              <sec id="bid.669">
                <title>Submission Procedures</title>
                <p><bold>Step 1. Initial Contact.</bold> A prospective provider can write to <email>linkout@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</email>, indicating interest in creating links from Entrez records to the providers' Web-accessible online resources. Please include the name, email address, and phone number of an individual who will act as a designated contact. The email should also include a LinkOut Identity file (providerinfo.xml) based on the specifications described above.</p>
                <p><bold>Step 2. File Evaluation.</bold> NCBI staff will evaluate the resources before a ProviderId and NameAbbr are assigned. NCBI will also provide assistance with setting up an appropriate Resource file to describe the LinkOut resources.</p>
                <p><bold>Step 3. File Submission.</bold> An FTP account will be assigned to a provider for submission. Files must have been validated by the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/linkout/validate.html">LinkOut Validation</ext-link> utility before uploading. Providers may transfer new versions of current files or add new Resource files at their own discretion. Providers are responsible for keeping their files current and valid. Links in Entrez databases are regenerated each day based on the files in each provider's directory; therefore, providers must delete obsolete files from their holdings directory.</p>
                <p><bold>Step 4. Representation in Entrez.</bold> Once a provider's LinkOut files are processed, the resources described in the file will be available in the LinkOut display of a relevant Entrez record as described in the above section, <italic>How Is LinkOut Represented in Entrez?</italic>. In PubMed, publishers of the abstract can choose to display a &ldquo;button&rdquo; on the Abstract and Citation displays of the PubMed record by adding the parameter &ldquo;holding=NameAbbr&rdquo; to the basic PubMed URL. For example, to activate the icon of WebDatabase Co, the URL would be provided as: <preformat>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?holding=WebDB</preformat>
			Furthermore, multiple NameAbbr parameters may be used in a URL to activate more than one icon. For example, to display icons for both WebDB and MyDB, the following URL should be provided: <preformat>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?holding=WebDB,MyDB</preformat>
			A provider's icon can be activated if the provider is selected from the LinkOut Preferences in Cubby.</p>
                <p>All access restrictions will still apply. For example, if access to a database is limited by the user IP address, access will only be allowed via computers within an approved IP range; if access is password protected, the password must still be entered.</p>

              <title>Summary</title>
              <p>The Reference Sequence (RefSeq) database provides a biologically non-redundant collection of DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. Each RefSeq represents a single, naturally occurring molecule from a particular organism. RefSeqs are frequently based on GenBank records but differ in that each RefSeq is a synthesis of information, not a piece of a primary research data in itself. Similar to a review article in the literature, a RefSeq is an interpretation by a particular group at a particular time. RefSeqs can be retrieved in several different ways: by searching the Entrez Nucleotide or Protein database, by BLAST searching, by FTP, or through links from other NCBI resources.</p>

              <p>The goal of the NCBI <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/RefSeq/">RefSeq</ext-link> project is to provide the best non-redundant and comprehensive collection of naturally occurring DNA, RNA, and protein molecules for major organisms. The collection explicitly links the nucleotide and protein sequences. Ideally, all molecule types will be available for each well-studied organism, but the current database collection pragmatically includes those molecules and organisms that are most readily identified, either by collaborators or NCBI processing of public sequence data. Thus, different amounts of information are available for different organisms at any given time. Intermediate records are provided for some organisms when the genome sequence is not yet finished.</p>
              <p>As a non-redundant collection of sequences, RefSeq offers a significant advantage during database searches or when identifying sequences (whether by BLAST, text, or accession queries, or inclusion in a local custom database). RefSeq represents an objective and experimentally verifiable definition of non-redundancy by providing one example of each natural biological molecule per organism. For some organisms, the RefSeq collection includes alternatively spliced transcripts that share some identical exons, or identical proteins expressed from these alternatively spliced transcripts, or close paralogs or homologs. RefSeq provides the substrate for a variety of objective conclusions about non-redundancy based on clustering identical sequences or families of related sequences.</p>
              <p>RefSeq is unique in providing a large, multi-species, curated sequence database that explicitly links chromosome, transcript, and protein information; it establishes a baseline for integrating sequence, genetic, expression, and functional information into a single, consistent framework. RefSeq is substantially based on GenBank sequence records (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.2">Chapter 1</xref>). Hereafter, the shorter term &ldquo;GenBank&rdquo; is used to indicate the full set of archival sequence data that is submitted to, and redistributed by, the three collaborating databases <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1272">DDBJ</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1281">EMBL</xref>, and <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1299">GenBank</xref>. RefSeq records include attribution to the original sequence data; however, RefSeq differs from GenBank in the same way that a review article differs from the relevant collection of primary research articles on the same subject. RefSeq represents a synthesis and summary of information by a person or group based on the primary information that was gathered by others. Other organizing principles or standards of judgment are possible, which is why such a work should be attributed to the synthesizing &ldquo;editors&rdquo;. RefSeq does not exclude other syntheses based on the same primary information. But, similar to a review article, it allows the comparison of many different observations taken over time. RefSeq also has the advantage of organizing a large body of diverse data into a single consistent framework with a uniform set of conventions and standards.</p>
              <p>Note that although based upon GenBank, RefSeq is distinct from GenBank. GenBank represents the sequence and annotations that are supplied by the original authors and is never changed by others. GenBank remains the primary sequence repository. RefSeq is one of many possible &ldquo;review articles&rdquo; based on that essential archive.</p>
              <p>The RefSeq collection establishes a consistent baseline and clear model of the central dogma. RefSeq standards support genome annotation, gene characterization, mutation analysis, expression studies, and polymorphism discovery. The RefSeq collection offers advantages in:

              <p>The current RefSeq collection includes sequences from over 2,000 distinct taxonomic identifiers, ranging from viruses to bacteria to eukaryotes. It represents chromosomes, organelles, plasmids, transcripts, and over 700,000 proteins. Every sequence is assigned a stable Accession number, version number, and gi number; older versions remain available if a sequence is updated over time. <xref ref-type="table" rid="bid.691">Table 1</xref> indicates the types of sequence molecules and the corresponding RefSeq Accession number formats.

                <p>RefSeq records appear similar in format to the GenBank records from which they are derived; distinguishing features include a unique accession prefix that includes an underscore, which is never present in a GenBank accession (<xref ref-type="table" rid="bid.691">Table 1</xref>), and a COMMENT field that indicates the RefSeq status and the source of the sequence information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.694">Figure 1</xref>). Some RefSeq records include feature annotation that is not present on the underlying GenBank record; new annotation is provided by computation as well as manual curation. For example, nucleotide variation features are computed using the data available in the dbSNP database (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1143">Chapter 5</xref>), and protein domains are computed using NCBI's Conserved Domain Database (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.94">Chapter 3</xref>).

                <p>The RefSeq database is compiled through several processes including collaboration, extraction from GenBank, and computation. Each molecule is annotated as accurately as possible with the correct organism name, correct gene symbol for that organism, and informative protein names whenever possible. Collaborations with authoritative groups outside of NCBI provide a variety of information ranging from curated sequence data, nomenclature, feature annotations, and links to external organism-specific resources. If a collaboration has not been established, then NCBI staff assembles the data from GenBank. Each record has a tag indicating the level of curation it has received (<xref ref-type="table" rid="bid.697">Table 2</xref>), and the collaborating group is attributed. Thus, the RefSeq record may be an essentially unchanged validated copy of the original GenBank record, or it may include corrected or additional information that has been added by collaborators or experts at NCBI.</p>
                <p>In cases when a molecule is represented by multiple sequences for an organism in GenBank, an effort is made by NCBI staff to select the &ldquo;best&rdquo; sequence to instantiate as a RefSeq. The goal is to avoid known mutations, sequencing errors, cloning artifacts, and erroneous annotation; should an existing RefSeq be identified with a problem of this type, it is corrected. Sequences are validated to confirm that the genomic sequence corresponding to an annotated mRNA feature matches the mRNA sequence record, and that coding region features really can be translated into the corresponding protein sequence.</p>
                <p>RefSeq records may be added to the collection, or existing records may be updated, on a daily basis. Separate working groups that use distinct process pipelines compile the RefSeq collection for different organisms. RefSeq records are provided by collaboration and the following three pipelines:

                <p>We welcome collaborations whenever authoritative groups outside NCBI are willing to provide sequences, nomenclature, annotations, or links to phenotypic or organism-specific resources. For some species, the RefSeq collection is curated entirely by a collaborating authoritative group that provides both the sequences and annotations. Other species may be provided via varying levels of collaborative efforts. For example, a <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PMGifs/Genomes/viradvisors.html">Viral Genome Advisory group</ext-link> has been established to support curation of the viral RefSeq collection. For some species, some information is provided by the external authoritative source, and some information is provided by NCBI. This process may be automated in that data are periodically downloaded and subject to validation to detect errors and apply annotation in a more uniform way; NCBI does not otherwise carry out additional curation to add annotation or make sequence changes to records supplied by collaborators. As the collaborating group supplies updates, changes are reflected in the RefSeq collection for that organism. Collaborator-supplied records have a REVIEWED status, and the collaborating group is identified. <xref ref-type="table" rid="bid.702">Table 3</xref> lists examples of curated and annotated sequence records provided wholly or in part through collaboration.</p>

                <p>NCBI is providing annotation of genomic sequence data for some genomes including some microbial species, human, and mouse. These pipelines are automated and yield genomic, transcript, and protein RefSeq records (records that are provided vary by organism). Data are refreshed periodically, and for the eukaryotic annotation pipeline, records are not subject to individual incremental updates or manual curation (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="bid.691">Table 1</xref>; see <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1440">Chapter 14</xref> for more information on the eukaryotic genome annotation pipeline).</p>

                <p>LocusLink supports the generation of RefSeq records for human, mouse, rat, fly, zebrafish, and cow; the RefSeq process for these organisms takes advantage of the descriptive information available in LocusLink. Multiple collaborations support the collection of this descriptive information (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bid.705">Box 1</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.788">Chapter 19</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> RefSeq collection is provided in collaboration with FlyBase, and numerous additional collaborations have occurred for individual genes and gene families, primarily for the human RefSeq collection.</p>
                <p>This data set consists of genomic regions, transcripts, and protein. Records representing genomic regions are provided primarily to support more comprehensive genome-level annotation and may represent gene clusters or single genes or pseudogenes. Records are annotated with the level of curation it has undergone; records may have an INFERRED, PREDICTED, PROVISIONAL, REVIEWED, or VALIDATED status (<xref ref-type="table" rid="bid.697">Table 2</xref>).</p>
                <p>Sequences in LocusLink records enter RefSeq by a mixture of computational analysis process, collaboration, and in-house curation. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.714">Figure 2</xref>, generation of the initial RefSeq record is dependent on first identifying a representative sequence for a gene in the LocusLink database. New genes are identified and added to the collection by collaborators or in-house processing that mines information available in UniGene, the Genome Annotation pipeline, and new GenBank submissions (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bid.705">Box 1</xref>). Once sequence data are associated with a LocusID, it is used as a query sequence for automated BLAST analysis. The longest mRNA that meets our stringent matching criteria is taken from the BLAST results; this is either a cDNA sequence or a mRNA feature annotated on a DNA sequence record. The identified sequence is subsequently used to provide the initial RefSeq record. This stage of the process includes detection of conflicts and problems including:

                      <p>Once a gene is defined and associated with sufficient sequence information in LocusLink, it can be pushed into the RefSeq pipeline. New genes are added to LocusLink by collaborators and in-house review. The RefSeq process is initiated by an automated BLAST step, which uses the sequence information in LocusLink as a query against GenBank to identify the longest mRNA for each locus. This sequence is represented as a provisional, predicted, or inferred RefSeq record. Subsequent review and curation may result in a sequence or annotation update (as described in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bid.720">Box 2</xref>). Records are refreshed if the underlying GenBank Accession number is updated or if an official nomenclature or cytogenetic map location is updated in LocusLink.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Conflicts and problems of these types must be resolved before the RefSeq can become public. Records are subject to validation to correct annotation errors and to provide annotation in a more consistent format. LocusLink descriptive information including official nomenclature, alias symbols, alternate descriptive names, map location, and additional citations are applied to the records. Records at this stage have a PROVISIONAL, PREDICTED, or INFERRED status.</p>
                <p>These initial records then enter into the in-house review pipeline, where additional manual curation may be applied. The review process prioritizes known genes, gene families, and problem cases that are identified through user input or analysis. The curation process includes analysis of a suite of precomputed BLAST results, literature review, review of available database and Web resources (both in-house and external), and collaboration to curate the nucleotide and protein sequence data and to apply additional annotation and descriptive information to both the RefSeq sequence record and to the LocusLink database. <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bid.720">Box 2</xref> lists more detailed information concerning the type of errors corrected and information added by the manual curation process. Sequence review is carried out primarily by NCBI staff, but some sequences and annotations are provided by collaboration including a portion of the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> RefSeq collection. The curation process also provides additional sequence records to represent splice variants when sufficient information about their full-length composition is available. Records that have undergone manual curation, either by NCBI staff or a collaborating group, have a VALIDATED or REVIEWED status. Note that for many genes, intermediate levels of manual curation occur to correct sequence mis-associations, to use a more optimal GenBank record, and to provide additional data to LocusLink before full review of a RefSeq sequence record.</p>
                <p>Additional ongoing review is applied to identified problem sets; for example, periodic analysis may be carried out to identify sequences that include repeats, that have poor-quality splice sites, are very short or very long, or that are extremely similar to sequences associated with a different LocusID. Review of problem sets may result in discontinuing a RefSeq, LocusID, or both. A RefSeq is suppressed if it is found to represent a transcribed repeat element, to be derived from the wrong organism (i.e., the GenBank sequence it was based on does not have accurate organism annotation), or to not represent a &ldquo;gene&rdquo;. An Entrez query will still retrieve a suppressed record, with a disclaimer appearing on the query result document summary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.751">Figure 3a</xref>), but the record is not included in the BLAST databases nor in the calculation of related sequences or the BLink display (precomputed protein BLAST results). If a RefSeq is found to be redundant with another public RefSeq, then one is retained and the other becomes a secondary Accession number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.751">Figure 3b</xref>). If the sequences were associated with two different LocusIDs, then the LocusIDs are merged so that in LocusLink, a query with either of the original LocusIDs will retrieve the remaining single record.<fig id="bid.751"><label>3</label><caption><title>How to recognize suppressed and redundant RefSeq records.</title><p>(<italic>a</italic>) A standard text statement is included on the Entrez document summary for suppressed RefSeq records (<italic>red arrow</italic>).

				<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=Genome">Genomes</ext-link> database represents a collection of complete, or nearly complete, genomes and chromosomes. It is divided into six large taxonomic groups: Archaea, Eubacteria, Eukaryotae, Viroids, Viruses, and Plasmids. See the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PMGifs/Genomes/org.html">Prominent Organisms</ext-link> page for a complete list of organisms included in this database; this list is automatically updated daily. Entrez Genomes RefSeq records include genomic, transcript, and protein records and are provided by collaboration, in-house automatic processing, and in-house curation. The Entrez Genomes Web site includes custom displays, analysis, and tools for some genomes (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="bid.1772">Table 4</xref>).</p>
                <p>In general, these RefSeq records undergo an initial automated validation step before being released. The resulting record is a copy of a GenBank entry, but validation may make some corrections and provides more consistent feature annotation. Records provided via collaboration have a status of REVIEWED and are attributed to the collaborating group. Records provided by in-house processing have a PROVISIONAL, VALIDATED, or REVIEWED status.</p>
                <p>Entrez Genomes record processing falls into four primary categories: chromosomes, microbial genomes, small complete genomes, and viruses.</p>

                    <bold>Chromosomes</bold>
                  </title>
                  <p>RefSeq records in this category are usually submitted directly to Entrez Genomes as a complete chromosome sequence representing an assembly of individual clones that are themselves available in GenBank. Examples of this type of RefSeq include <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans.</italic> In addition, RefSeq records may be available for some genomes that are not yet fully complete but for which complete sequence is available for individual chromosomes; for example, a RefSeq chromosome 1 record is provided for <italic>Leishmania major</italic>.</p>
                  <p>These records are curated by the organism-specific collaborating group and undergo NCBI validation before being released. The validation process checks for logical conflicts in the annotation (which are reported back to the submitting group) and makes small modifications to format the submission as a RefSeq record. This category of RefSeq record is displayed using the NCBI Map Viewer (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1562">Chapter 20</xref>) in addition to being available in the main Entrez sequence databases. An organism-specific genome BLAST service is provided for these genomic, transcript, and protein records.</p>

                  <p>Microbial complete genomes are submitted to GenBank, but because of the GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ collaboration agreement, which limits the size to 350 kb, they are made available in GenBank as a series of Accession numbers. RefSeq does not need to adhere to this upper limit, and therefore complete genome sequences are available as RefSeq records in Entrez Genomes.</p>
                  <p>These records are subject to additional automated validation and computational analysis; the computational analysis results are then manually reviewed, resulting in more complete annotation of the RefSeq record (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="bid.1773">Table 5</xref>).</p>

                  <p>Smaller complete genomic sequences, including organelles, plasmids, and viruses, are based on single GenBank records. Automatic processing scans GenBank daily for complete genome updates and new submissions; identified records are candidates for a complete genome RefSeq. These records are manually evaluated to make the final decision; if more than one genomic sequence is available for the genome, then only one is selected to become the RefSeq standard. This selection takes into account various factors including the level of annotation, strain information, and community input.</p>
                  <p>Some of these RefSeq records undergo manual curation and have a REVIEWED status. For example, viral genomes are re-annotated using GeneMarkS in collaboration with Mark Borodovsky's Bioinformatics Group at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Following <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://opal.biology.gatech.edu/GeneMark/">GeneMarkS</ext-link> analysis, viral genomes are subject to manual review by NCBI staff. Viral annotation also relies on an established <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PMGifs/Genomes/viradvisors.html">Viral Genome Advisors</ext-link> group.

              <p>RefSeq records can be accessed by direct query, BLAST and FTP download, or indirectly through links provided from several NCBI resources. In addition, RefSeqs are included in some computed resources, and therefore links may be found from those pages to individual RefSeq records. For example, the RefSeq collection is included in Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COG; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.885">Chapter 22</xref>) analysis and in Conserved Domain Database (CDD; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.94">Chapter 3</xref>) analysis to identify proteins with similar domain architecture. Some links to RefSeq records are based on LocusLink associations (e.g., links from OMIM; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.405">Chapter 7</xref>), whereas others are based on sequence similarity.

Loci with associated RefSeq records can be retrieved using the controlled query term &ldquo;has_refseq&rdquo;. LocusLink query results and gene reports indicate when a RefSeq is available, with links provided to the nucleotide and protein sequences and to related resources, including the Map Viewer and BLink (precomputed protein alignments) and Conserved Domain Database (CDD).

                <p>RefSeq transcript and protein records are included in the non-redundant nucleotide and protein BLAST databases, and genomic sequences are included in the &ldquo;chromosome&rdquo; database; therefore, when a query sequence matches a RefSeq record, the hit is included in the BLAST results (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.774">Figure 5</xref>). Additional organism-specific BLAST pages provide access to specific custom databases, which vary by organism as needed. For example, the human genome BLAST page provides access to query the RefSeq contigs, transcripts, or proteins in addition to (human) sequences in the GenBank High-Throughput Genomic (HTG) division.<fig id="bid.774"><label>5</label><caption><title>RefSeq records are included in NCBI BLAST databases.</title><p>In a BLAST summary list of results, the abbreviation <italic>ref</italic> identifies records that are provided by the RefSeq collection.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch18f5" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>

              <title>Summary</title>
              <p>LocusLink organizes information from collaborating public databases and from other groups within NCBI to provide a locus-centered view of genomic information from human, mouse, rat, zebrafish, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, and human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). Each LocusLink record (one for each locus) consists of a collection of links to more information about a locus. The intent, therefore, is not to copy all information about a locus into one record; the intent is to provide a sufficient description of each linked item so that LocusLink can be searched and to provide enough connections for users to find related resources. As part of this process, a unique integer is assigned to each locus. This identifier can then be used by other resources to connect back to LocusLink.</p>

              <title>Overview</title>
              <p>LocusLink serves as a hub of information for <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1332">loci</xref> from several model organisms: human, mouse, rat, fruit fly, and human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). On a regular basis, &ldquo;source&rdquo; databases are checked for novel information about genes or other loci. If the record already exists in LocusLink, the novel information is added. Otherwise, a new record is created. Because many of the contributing databases are curated and because the LocusLink records are reviewed by NCBI staff, LocusLink can be considered a curated resource.</p>
              <p>LocusLink gathers information from databases both within and external to NCBI. These are scanned using a combination of automatic and manual techniques. LocusLink collaborates with organism-specific and nomenclature databases, from which a combination of sequence data and names are used to initiate new LocusLink records. LocusLink also finds new records by a weekly review of submissions to GenBank and new versions of UniGene (which are released periodically). Each new LocusLink record is assigned a unique identifying number that is tracked, a LocusID.</p>
              <p>LocusLink records are used in turn by UniGene, dbSNP, and the organism-specific and nomenclature databases. For example, a new LocusLink record created on the basis of a sequence submitted to GenBank can be the basis for a new entry in an organism-specific database. This new defining sequence of the LocusLink record is &ldquo;<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1246">BLAST</xref>ed&rdquo; against sequences from the same or other genomes, which identifies other <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1299">GenBank</xref> records for the same gene or its homologs. When a related sequence is identified in a genome within the scope of LocusLink and that sequence has not yet been included in the appropriate genome-specific database, LocusLink makes the connection and reports it for others to use.</p>
              <p>LocusLink also feeds new sequences into the Reference Sequence (RefSeq) project. The prerequisite for this process is that the sequence encodes a complete protein. For more details about how eukaryotic RefSeq mRNA and protein records are initiated, see <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.681">Chapter 18</xref> in this Handbook.</p>
              <p>Although historically many of the GenBank sequences used to initiate LocusLink records represented characterized genes sequenced by individual research labs, an increasing number of records in LocusLink are generated as a part of NCBI's genome annotation pipeline (see <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1440">Chapter 14</xref>). The IDs assigned to these records are termed &ldquo;interim IDs&rdquo; and are not tracked within the LocusLink database until they have been reviewed or a preponderance of evidence confirms that the gene prediction is real.</p>
              <p>In summary, no matter whether the data are stored as a result of curation or computation, the central function of LocusLink is to establish an accurate connection between the defining sequence for a locus and other descriptors for that locus. With such a connection in place, it is possible to:

              <p>The <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/LocusLink/index.html">LocusLink homepage</ext-link> gives a brief introduction to the resource as well as information on new features. At the top of this and all LocusLink pages is a query bar that allows users to search not only LocusLink but also a selection of other resources within NCBI. Thus, if a query against LocusLink does not return a result, a different resource can be selected and searched without retyping the query term. Currently, these other resources include: OMIM, PubMed, Entrez Nucleotide, Entrez Protein, Human Map Viewer, UniGene, and UniSTS. The default for LocusLink queries is to search all of the available organisms, although a specific organism can be selected by using the pull-down menu in the search bar.</p>
              <p>LocusLink supports several types of queries, including gene names, GenBank Accession numbers, and other resource-specific ID numbers such as <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1424">UniGene cluster</xref> or <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1410">STS</xref> marker IDs. Queries are not case sensitive, and retrievals are based on a word index, not a phrase index. Punctuation is not removed; thus, entering the query <italic>beta actin</italic> will retrieve any record that contains the word &ldquo;beta&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;actin&rdquo; (processed as &ldquo;beta AND actin&rdquo;). <italic>&ldquo;beta actin&rdquo;</italic> will retrieve No Results, because the quotes are not removed, and look-up fails on <italic>&ldquo;beta&rdquo;</italic> or <italic>actin?</italic>. More advanced searches can limit queries to specific fields (<xref ref-type="table" rid="bid.794">Table 1</xref>) or by controlled terms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="bid.795">Table 2</xref>). Further information on options for formulating queries are documented in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/LocusLink/help.html">Help</ext-link> pages.</p>
              <p>A query on the LocusLink homepage returns a report page that is organized in a tabular format, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.796">Figure 1</xref>. The complete record is viewed by selecting <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Locus ID</named-content> or <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">More</named-content> (for interim IDs from the annotation pipeline).

              <title>A LocusLink Report: The Details</title>
              <p>This section is organized according to the features and subdivisions seen on a LocusLink report page, from top to bottom. We will illustrate the descriptions of the features by using screen shots from the LocusLink report of BRCA2 and CDKN1A interacting protein (BCCIP; LocusID <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/LocusLink/LocRpt.cgi?l=56647">56647</ext-link>).
		</p>
              <p>On each LocusLink report page, the first set of links is a table of contents for the sections included in the report being displayed, which are hyperlinked to the appropriate section. <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Top of page</named-content> links to the top.

                <title>mRNA&ndash;Genomic Alignments Diagram</title>
                <p>As part of the genome annotation process at NCBI, GenBank and RefSeq mRNAs are aligned to genomic <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1267">contig</xref>s to determine the exon/intron organization of genes. The results of these calculations can be displayed using NCBI's <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/Genome/evvdoc.html">Evidence Viewer</ext-link>.</p>
                <p>The diagram at the top of a LocusLink report represents the intron/exon structure of the gene as determined by the Genome Annotation Pipeline (see <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1440">Chapter 14</xref>). For example, the annotation for BCCIP looks like this (the details may change with each reannotation of the genome): <inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch19df1" mime-subtype="gif"/></p>
                <p>This abbreviated output displays the longest alignment, where tick marks indicate the positions of the exons. Genes with a single exon are represented as a solid thick bar with flanking horizontal lines. The diagram is hyperlinked to the Evidence Viewer, which in turn is linked to the appropriate Entrez Nucleotide records by the Accession number of each sequence. Mousing over the individual entries in the Evidence Viewer displays a definition line from that sequence record.</p>

                <p>LocusLink uses symbols and gene names from official authority lists when available. If no connection to official nomenclature can be made, symbols and names are selected as available from the defining sequence record. If sequence and positional homology (synteny) suggest that a locus not named officially in one species is orthologous to a named gene in another species, the symbol from the ortholog may be included in the LocusLink record. If no symbol can be identified for a new locus, the letters LOC are prepended to the LocusID. Once an official or meaningful symbol has been identified, that LOC symbol is discontinued (because the record will still be searchable and identified by the LocusID itself).</p>

                  <p>Information on the nomenclature authorities that collaborate with LocusLink can be viewed by following the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/LocusLink/LLnomen.html">Nomenclature</ext-link> link on the LocusLink homepage. Except for the human genome, data from these authorities are imported automatically and used either to correct existing LocusLink names or to create new records. For the human genome, the Human Gene Nomenclature Committee has direct access to the LocusLink database and inserts and updates records interactively.</p>

                  <p><bold>Rules.</bold> In addition to official symbols and full names, LocusLink provides other symbols and names seen in publications and sequence records appropriate to the locus. These alternative names are not meant to be comprehensive and are usually reviewed only when the RefSeq is being reviewed.</p>
                  <p><bold>Stability and Tracking.</bold> Although LocusLink does maintain some nomenclature history, the appropriate nomenclature committee performs this function more comprehensively. For individual LocusLink records, links to those committees are provided from the LocusLink report.</p>
                  <p><bold>Update Frequency.</bold> Official nomenclature is modified when changes are available, ranging from daily (human, mouse) to weekly (zebrafish), or longer (fly, rat). Names provided by NCBI staff are available daily.</p>
                  <p><bold>Methods.</bold> Data files are imported by FTP and analyzed through a combination of shell and Perl scripts, in conjunction with relational database tables used to hold the input data. Records with no data conflicts are updated automatically. If a flag is raised because of uncertainty about the relationships among a name, a sequence, and a record identifier, then an expert reviews that record. During review, either the record is corrected or the appropriate nomenclature committee(s) is contacted to resolve the discrepancies.</p>

                <p>For human genes, links to OMIM, if available, are given under the heading Phenotype. For all genomes, links to the published literature are provided under the heading Gene References into Function (GeneRIF). Any user can submit a reference to a paper they think is important for a locus, but beginning in February 2002, these links are also supplied by <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1341">MeSH</xref> indexers at the National Library of Medicine.</p>

                <p>We plan to expand this section to include other types of pairwise relationships. For example, &ldquo;overlap&rdquo;, &ldquo;interspersed&rdquo;, and &ldquo;protein binds&rdquo; will refer to genes that overlap, that are contained in or contain another gene, and for which the encoded proteins interact, respectively. Although primarily for relationships within a species, when proteins of one species interact with those of another (e.g., infectious agents), such a relationship will be reported in this section as well.</p>

                <title>Map Information</title>
                <p>This section reports map data for the locus. The location listed is the same as that on the LocusLink query result page, but if there are any conflicts, additional locations may be reported, along with the source of the conflicting data and a link to that resource.<inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch19df7" mime-subtype="gif"/></p>
                <p>For the human and mouse genomes, if no published map location has been identified and if the gene has been aligned to NCBI's genome assembly, the cytogenetic position is recalculated with each build. The conversion files used in the process are <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/H_sapiens/maps/mapview/ISCN800_abc">ISCN800_abc</ext-link> for human. This location is also displayed from <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1336">Map Viewer</xref>. With each assembly of the genome, genes reported to be on one chromosome that appear to have better alignments on a different chromosome are identified. If marker and other data are consistent but distinct from the published map location, then the LocusLink report will be modified to conform to the evidence gained from analysis of the human genome.</p>
                <p>Genetic and physical map positions are incorporated from the published maps used in Map Viewer. Rather than report all position data for any locus in any coordinate system, links are provided to Map Viewer via the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">mv</named-content> link in the map section or indirectly through the marker names, which are linked to the UniSTS record.</p>

                  </title>
                  <p>In LocusLink, markers are defined as sequence tagged sites (STSs) associated with the locus. LocusLink reports markers either as the locus itself or as a marker that has some relationship with a gene. LocusLink does not store all of the markers available for a genome, which is the function of <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1425">UniSTS</xref>. Some LocusLink records contain only markers. These are considered historical records; new records are added only if a contributing database reports a marker to represent a gene.</p>

                    <title>Information Sources</title>
                    <p>The marker data that LocusLink reports come primarily from any of the following paths: (1) a report from a genome-specific database that states that a marker is within a gene or locus; (2) for genes, a caluculation based on <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1284">e-PCR</xref> using mRNA as the electronic template, that the marker is within a mRNA defined to be associated with genes; and (3) for genes and in genomes for which NCBI is making an assembly and/or providing annotation e-PCR based on placement of a marker within the range beginning 2.0 kb upstream of the most 5&prime; mRNA alignment of a gene feature and ending 0.5 kb downstream of the most 3&prime; mRNA alignment.</p>

                    <p><bold>Rules.</bold> Markers are included in a locus report if they can be assayed by PCR, i.e., if a marker is a STS, and if, according to current computation, they are detected at no more than two locations in the genome being reported.</p>
                    <p><bold>Stability and Tracking.</bold> Relationships between STS and gene records are not archived or tracked. New markers may be added to a gene report if more sequence is identified as being valid for a gene and the new marker &ldquo;detects&rdquo; that sequence by e-PCR. A marker may be removed from a report if the sequence that it detected is no longer considered valid for that gene.</p>
                    <p><bold>Update Frequency.</bold> The LocusID-to-UniSTS marker relationship that is based on e-PCR from mRNA templates is calculated daily. The LocusID-to-UniSTS marker relationship that is based on genome annotation is recalculated with each genome build.</p>

If alternate splice variants have been reviewed, a brief description of each is included. If there is a protein and it demonstrates significant sequence matches to domains defined in the Conserved Domain Database (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1257">CDD</xref>), then the domains are listed by name, with the score for the domain match. A link is also provided to the CDD browser. To facilitate identification of related proteins and structures, <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">BL</named-content> provides a link to <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1250">BLink</xref>, a resource of precalculated BLAST searches for any given protein.</p>

The first Accession number(s) displayed is the genomic record (contig), as well as links to the genomic sequence containing the gene (<named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">gb</named-content>), a graphic sequence view (<named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">sv</named-content>), the Map Viewer display for that contig (<named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">mv</named-content>), the Evidence Viewer (<named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">ev</named-content>), and Model Maker (<named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">mm</named-content>. Please note that the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">mv</named-content> link in this section is contig based, whereas the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">mv</named-content> link in the map section is based on the locus itself. These links are provided to make it easier to: retrieve a gene-specific region of a large chromosomal sequence, rather than finding that gene in a record that may be several megabases (<named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">gb</named-content>); review the alignment evidence for a gene that has been annotated on a genomic assembly (<named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">ev</named-content>); and construct your own mRNA model(s) in a genomic region based on mRNA and ESTs that align there (<named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">mm</named-content>). The next Accession numbers listed are for sequences annotated on the genomic sequence. They may be the same as the curated RefSeq in the previous category, or they may be models, distinguished by the format of their Accession numbers (XM_000000, XP_000000, and XR_000000 refer to models). CDD domain matches and BLink links are also provided for model proteins.</p>
                <p>The <italic>GenBank Sequences</italic> section provides a list of representative nucleotide and protein Accession numbers for the locus, each Accession number of which is linked to an Entrez sequence display. Proteins listed in this section also provide a link to BLink.</p>

              <p>LocusLink records can be categorized by two major criteria: the type of locus being described and the tracking maintained for the record (<xref ref-type="table" rid="bid.848">Table 4</xref>). All but the interim loci (ascribed to LocusLink records that are based on gene-prediction software only) are tracked, which means that if the record is discontinued or determined to be redundant with another, queries based on the ID representing the discontinued or secondary record will return a result. For interim loci, the interim identifier is not reused, but a query based on that identifier number will not return a result if that gene model is no longer being annotated. It is anticipated that the number of interim loci will decrease as more curation is applied to the records of the genome.</p>

              <p>The database supporting LocusLink houses more than only the unique loci identifiers for the genomes in its scope. It also records, whenever possible, the public sequence Accession numbers that define these loci and, along with its collaborators, applies several tests for data consistency. Thus, the relationships between LocusID and sequence Accession numbers are used by other databases at NCBI to convert information about mRNA or protein sequences to the LocusID and all other information associated with that LocusID (name, database cross-references, protein product, and others). These relationships are outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="bid.855">Table 6</xref>.</p>

              <title>Summary</title>
              <p>There are many different approaches to starting a genomic analysis. These include literature searching, searching databases for gene names and other genomic features, performing sequence comparisons, or using map data to find gene information by position relative to other landmarks. The NCBI Map Viewer has been developed to facilitate this latter approach.</p>
              <p>The purpose of this chapter is to provide a foundation for gaining maximum benefit from using the Map Viewer and related resources at NCBI. It is important to note that in this document, the term &ldquo;map&rdquo; refers to a position of a particular type of object in a particular coordinate system. This means, for example, that there is not one sequence map but a set of maps in sequence coordinates. Readers interested in precisely how sequence-based maps are annotated and assembled should refer to <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1440">Chapter 14</xref>.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>First launched with the release of the sequence of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> in March 2000, Map Viewer is now used to present genetic, radiation hybrid (RH), cytogenetic, breakpoint, sequence-based, and clone maps for many genomes. The availability of whole genome sequences means that objects such as genes, markers, clones, sites of variation, and clone boundaries can be positioned by aligning defining sequence from these objects against the genomic sequence. This position information can then be compared to information about order obtained by other means, such as genetic or physical mapping. The results of sequence-based queries (e.g., BLAST) can also be viewed in genomic context. Our view of the genomes of a variety of organisms is constantly being improved through the increase in underlying data.</p>
              <p>Map Viewer integrates map and sequence data from a variety of sources. The basic architecture and principle of Map Viewer can be applied to any complete or incomplete genome as long as map data exist to support it. Map Viewer is a powerful tool because it provides: (1) a mechanism to compare maps in different coordinate systems; (2) a robust query interface; (3) diverse options for configuring the display; (4) multiple functions to report and download maps and annotated information; (5) tools to manipulate nucleotide sequence such as <!--<glossref>-->ModelMaker<!--</glossref>--> (for constructing mRNAs from putative exon sequences); (6) connections to comprehensive data files for transfer by FTP; and (7) detailed descriptions of the objects displayed on the maps.</p>

                <title>Data Sources</title>
                <p><bold>Non-Sequence-based Maps.</bold> Sources of maps that are not based directly on sequence include published maps in genetic, radiation hybrid, cytogenetic, and ordinal coordinate systems (where ordinal refers to clone order). The primary sources of each map are described in the online help documentation of each genome-specific Map Viewer. We are indebted to the researchers who make their mapping results so freely available. When a new version of any map becomes available, the data are also updated in the appropriate NCBI database.</p>
                <p><bold>Sequence-based Maps.</bold> The sequence-based maps shown through Map Viewer can be supplied by external sources and/or supplied from features computed within NCBI. For example, when the annotated sequence for a complete genome is submitted to the sequence databases (GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ), a copy of the data may also be accessioned as Reference Sequences (RefSeqs; see <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.681">Chapter 18</xref>). The gene, transcript, and other feature annotations of the submitted complete genome are processed for display in the Map Viewer. NCBI staff may then calculate and display the position of other types of features, such as marker position or points of variation, as separate maps (<xref ref-type="table" rid="bid.1565">Table 1</xref>).</p>

                <p>Some of the annotation of genomic sequence carried out by NCBI is included in the genomic reference sequences (NC, NT, and NW Accession number format); however, other annotation is represented only in the Map Viewer and in the associated reports (<xref ref-type="table" rid="bid.1565">Table 1</xref>). This latter type of annotation is based on information in several NCBI databases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="bid.1566">Table 2</xref>) and is particularly important for attaching biological information to sequence data. Links to these resources are provided in Map Viewer to provide further information about each annotated object. It should be noted, however, that although sequence features may be placed in a genomic context automatically, there are curation steps that affect the final displays. For example, for the human and mouse genomes, sequences defining genes and pseudogenes are reviewed by collaborators and NCBI staff and, whenever possible, used as the basis of RefSeq records (NG, NM, and NR Accession number format).</p>

                <p>Feature annotation is computed primarily in two ways: (1) by alignment of the defining sequence to the genome; or (2) for sequence tagged sites (STSs), by e-PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.1625">1</xref>). In some genomes, gene placement is based primarily on the alignment of mRNA [Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) and cDNAs], but only when an encoded protein is predicted. In other cases, where transcription evidence is weaker, more weight is given to identification of protein-coding regions. Gene identification is also constrained in that a known gene cannot be placed more than once in a haplotype (except for pseuodo-autosomal regions) or on an incorrect chromosome. Thus, if any reference haplotype retains inappropriately redundant sequence that encodes a gene, only one copy will be annotated as that gene. Others will be assigned interim IDs (see <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1440">Chapter 14</xref>). Some <italic>ab initio</italic> methods may also be used for gene prediction. The predicted genes, as well as the mRNAs, are supplied as separate maps (gene, RNA, or <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1301">GenomeScan</xref> maps).</p>
                <p>In some cases, the position of these features may suggest the location of other genomic regions of interest. For example, the position of STS markers can help define the position of phenotypes such as quantitative trait loci (QTL). Although the best annotation of a gene or region is always through annotation by an expert researcher, automated annotation of genomes and comparison to that provided by experts can provide significant useful information.

                <title>Relationships among Coordinate Systems</title>
                <p>In addition to supporting the display of multiple maps in the same coordinate system (e.g., multiple sequence-based maps), Map Viewer also displays maps in different coordinate systems by calculating the correspondances among them (e.g., sequence to genetic). This is accomplished by: (<italic>a</italic>) identifying features that have been placed on maps in different coordinate systems; and (<italic>b</italic>) using general conversion factors. In the first case, placement of STSs on the genome is critical for the integration of sequence data with other, non-sequence-based maps, such as genetic and RH maps. The integration of cytogenetic data with sequence data is achieved through alignment of sequence from clones that have been placed cytogentically, such as the human fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH)-mapped clones from the Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) Resource Consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.1626">2</xref>). The integration of non-sequence-based maps with the sequence provides a powerful mechanism to access portions of sequence on the basis of marker or cytogenetic data. Many features, such as Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), ESTs, mRNAs, whole genome shotgun reads, and clones can be placed on the genome assembly by using standard DNA sequence alignment methods such as BLAST.</p>
                <p>The identification of known genes within the genome assembly provides critical landmarks and functional context to the sequence data, which in turn makes it easier to traverse to other rich sources of gene and protein information, including publications, OMIM, RefSeq, Conserved Domain Database (CDD), and LocusLink.</p>
                <p>The power of calculating correspondances between coordinate systems may be more apparent when considering a common application of Map Viewer, i.e., identifying candidate genes within a region defined by genetic markers. When markers are palced on both genetic and sequence maps, it is then possible to use the gene-related maps (gene, UniGene/EST, or <italic>ab initio</italic> predictions) to identify possible genes of interest. For more details on how to do this, see the Map Viewer Exercises in <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1679">Chapter 23</xref>.</p>

                <title>A Work in Progress</title>
                <p>For many genomes, identifying and positioning chromosomes and genes within sequence blocks is an ongoing process. In those cases, the Map Viewer can be used to evaluate the evidence that supports the current representation of the sequence and visualize possible conflicts. Inconsistencies in map order or in the placement of any object can be seen in the Map Viewer; this is assisted in some cases by the use of color coding (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.1569">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.1570">2</xref>).<fig id="bid.1569"><label>1</label><caption><title>Evaluation of a chromosome sequence (STS) map.</title><p>Potential inconsistencies in the order or orientation of sequence blocks can be investigated by displaying a genetic map (<italic>Marshfield</italic>), radiation hybrid map (<italic>TNG</italic>), and sequence map (<italic>STS</italic>) together and checking the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Show connections</named-content> box in the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Maps &amp; Options</named-content> window. Note that some of the <italic>gray lines</italic> (connecting the same marker on different maps) are <italic>crossed</italic>, indicating that either the placement is incorrect on a map or the chromosome sequence is not ordered and oriented consistently with all map data.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch20f1" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig><fig id="bid.1570"><label>2</label><caption><title>Evaluation of gene localization and annotation.</title><p>A comparison of cDNA alignments (UniGene, RNA) and gene predictions (GenomeScan) to the genomic contig annotation can be achieved by displaying three maps simultaneously. The genomic contig (NT_024981.9) annotation is shown in the <italic>Genes_seq</italic> map and is displayed with the GenomeScan predictions (the <italic>GScan</italic> map) and the EST/mRNA alignments labeled by human UniGene clusters (the <italic>UniG_Hs</italic> map). Note that in this case, there are two sequence objects not included in the contig annotation: one is an <italic>ab initio</italic> prediction (the last model in the GScan map) (<italic>a</italic>); and the other is either some small gene or an alternative 3&prime; exon for PIK3C3 from the UniG_Hs map (<italic>b</italic>). This approach is especially useful when reviewing BLAST results in a genomic context.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch20f2" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>
                <p>For some genomes, the color-coded contig map displays whether the annotation is based on sequence assembled from draft or finished clones (blue, finished; green, whole genome shotgun; orange, draft). This is helpful when evaluating the level of confidence in the completeness of the annotation of a gene and/or its coding region.</p>
                <p>Map Viewer also uses color coding or diagrams to represent the level of confidence in the placement of any mapped object. For example, SNPs or STSs that are placed at more that one position in a given map are noted by color (yellow) in the detailed labels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.1571">Figure 3a</xref>). Annotated genes are shown in different colors, based on the source and level of confidence in the annotation or the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.1571">Figure 3b</xref>).<fig id="bid.1571"><label>3</label><caption><title>Representation of ambiguity.</title><p>
							(<italic>a</italic>) The marker D1S2894 is found on several maps. Note that for the first map (<italic>STS</italic>), the circle is diagonally split with two colors. The diagonal means that the marker has been placed more than once; the two colors mean that the placements are not on the same chromosome. (<italic>b</italic>) A Map Viewer display of a region of chromosome 16. SNPs that are placed more than once on the chromosome are designated by a <italic>yellow triangle</italic>. From the <italic>Contig</italic> map, it appears that at least one of these SNPs (rs3220808) is placed both on draft sequence (<italic>orange</italic>) and on finished sequence (<italic>blue</italic>). This may be an artifact resulting from misassembly or perhaps a region of segmental duplication. This diagram also illustrates the use of color to indicate the source and level of confidence in annotated genes. <italic>Blue</italic> indicates a confirmed gene with no conflicts; <italic>light green</italic> indicates EST evidence only; <italic>dark brown</italic> indicates a GenomeScan prediction with protein homology; <italic>orange</italic> means that there is a conflict between the annotated gene and the mRNA evidence. (<italic>Ab initio</italic> predictions from GenomeScan are categorized into two types, based on presence or absence of sequence similarity to vertebrate proteins or protein domains.)</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch20f3" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>

                <title>Frequency of Updates</title>
                <p>Although maps provided from external sources are updated when new data are available, the maps dependent on NCBI's annotation process are updated periodically in versions called &ldquo;builds&rdquo;. Thus, mRNA or other supporting evidence that becomes available after the data &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; date for one build will not be incorporated into the display until the next build. However, some of the supporting databases linked from the Map Viewer may have more updated information. For example, UniSTS may provide more recent e-PCR results, or LocusLink may show a newer name or additional sequence data. dbSNP may make major data releases between builds; in this case, the variation map is updated.</p>

Genome-specific BLAST searches can be accessed from the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/">BLAST</ext-link> homepage, the Map Viewer pages of individual organisms (e.g., <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/Entrez/map_search">human</ext-link>, <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/Entrez/map_srchdb?chr=mouse_chr.inf">mouse</ext-link>), and the genome-specific resource pages of individual organisms. If the reference genome (the default) is selected as the database to be searched, the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Genome View</named-content> button (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.1578">Figure 6</xref>) will appear on the BLAST results display page.<fig id="bid.1578"><label>6</label><caption><title>Accessing the Map Viewer display from a genome-specific BLAST results page.</title><p>Selecting the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Genome View</named-content> button shows all of the BLAST hits on the genome. <!--See Exercises (Gene Family).--></p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch20f5" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>

                  </title>
                  <p>When already at a genome-specific Map Viewer page, any combination of query terms can be entered into a Map Viewer <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Search for</named-content> box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.1581">Figure 7</xref>). Boolean operators (AND, OR, and NOT) and the use of <bold>*</bold> as a wild card (applied to the right of any term) are supported. The <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Search for</named-content> and <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Help</named-content> document hyperlinks provide current details about query options. An advanced search is available for some genomes.<fig id="bid.1581"><label>7</label><caption><title>Representative of species-specific homepage.</title><p>Note the links to the help documentation and related resources. Also note the check boxes to use the advanced query page and/or to display objects calculated to have links to any object returned by the query. A link to the genome-specific BLAST site is also provided at the <italic>top</italic> of the form.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch20f7" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>
                  <p>Queries may include any unique identifier for a database record, e.g., a sequence Accession number or OMIM (MIM) number, or a text term or phrase, e.g., a gene symbol (BRCA2) or descriptor (p53-binding), or disease name (lung cancer). The Boolean AND operator is used automatically if multiple terms are entered. Therefore, a query for &ldquo;fanconi anemia&rdquo; will automatically be interpreted as &ldquo;fanconi AND anemia&rdquo;. The wildcard operator (*) provides a convenient mechanism to retrieve genes that share a common symbol or name, as is often found for gene families. For example, a query for ABC* will return matches to the ATP-binding cassette superfamily.</p>
                  <p>The advanced query page, accessed by checking the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Advanced search</named-content> box, provides additional options to refine a query. These additional options, which may vary from genome to genome, are useful for restricting queries to a particular search field or map type. The advanced query page also includes predefined search options to restrict the search to data with certain properties, e.g., to only find genes associated with a known disease or with sequence variation (SNPs). Additional refinements to queries against the variation map can also be made, for example, to search for variation markers known to be in a gene or coding region.</p>
                  <p>The same options for wild cards and Boolean operators for your query term(s) apply when starting at the Map Viewer <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview">homepage</ext-link>. At present, however, you must select a genome to which to restrict your search. An option to query across multiple genomes is under development.</p>

                  </title>
                  <p>To use Map Viewer to display a particular section of a genome by using a range of positions as a query, it is first necessary to select a particular chromosome for display from either a genome-specific Map Viewer page or a Genome Guide page.</p>
                  <p>Once a single chromosome is displayed, position-based queries can be defined by: (1) entering a value into the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Region Shown</named-content> box. This could be a numerical range (base pairs are the default if no units are entered), the names of clones, genes, markers, SNPs, or any combination. The screen will be refreshed with only that region shown. If the first entry cannot be resolved, the display will extend to the top of the map; if the second entry cannot be resolved, the display will extend to the bottom of the map. Both of these navigational aids are found on the left of the page; and (2) using the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Maps &amp; Options</named-content> controls. One of the options in this menu is to define the region shown. Here it may be clearer that the region selected will be in the coordinates of the rightmost, or Master, map, which may also be adjusted in this menu. The values that can be used to specify the range are the same as those described in (1), above. (See <italic>Customizing the Display</italic> for more details on fine-tuning.)</p>
                  <p>Tutorials in Chpater 23, particularly #2, provide more examples of querying Map Viewer by position.</p>

                <p>The results from a query are displayed both graphically and in a summary table (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.1585">Figure 8</xref>). When the query is executed by BLAST, the graphical view is color-coded according to the BLAST score, and the table summarizes the scores and the RefSeq Accession numbers that have matches. <!--Exercises (Gene Family)-->Clicking on the RefSeq Accession number (i.e., those beginning with NT_ or NW_) displays that BLAST result in the Map Viewer.<fig id="bid.1585"><label>8</label><caption><title>Map Viewer query results.</title><p>

The complete results for a particular chromosome can be displayed by selecting the name of the chromosome on the graphical portion of the display or selecting <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">all matches</named-content> in the summary table. The number of matches per chromosome is reported under each chromosome in the graphical overview, and the total number of results returned is indicated below that. Additional pages are provided if the query returns over 100 results. The table indicates the chromosomal location, the match found, the map element returned, the type of match found, and the specific map(s) that contains the query match. Only the first 40 characters are shown in the <italic>Match</italic> column, and therefore the portion of text that matches the query may not be displayed. All maps that contain any object are viewed by selecting the name of the object in the <italic>Map element</italic> column. To see only one map, select the name of that map. In some cases, the resultant display will contain related maps in the same sequence coordinates.

The view automatically centers on a highlighted query term, or on the middle of the chromosome if browsing only. The chromosome view can be moved up and down or zoomed in and out. Zooming can be achieved in several ways: (1) by using the zoom control, located in the left column; (2) by providing a range or bounding markers in the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Region Shown</named-content> text boxes; or (3) by selecting part of the map to display a menu with predefined zoom levels.

For display and query purposes, different types of features annotated on sequence coordinates are treated as different maps. The maps in sequence coordinates are comparable because all of the sequence maps are based on the reference to a standard genome assembly. Thus, one can display the SNP map (at high zoom level) next to the Gene, UniGene, or GenomeScan map to ascertain the number and location of polymorphisms in a region.</p>
                <p>Some basic map controls are available directly on the display including removal of a map from the display by clicking on the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">X</named-content> over the map and moving a secondary map to the Master Map position by clicking on the arrow next to the map label.</p>
                <p>The <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Maps&amp;Options</named-content> window provides advanced options to: (<italic>a</italic>) add a ruler to any map; (<italic>b</italic>) reset the page length to display more (or less) information; (<italic>c</italic>) define region to display by providing coordinates or marker name in <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Region Shown</named-content> boxes (also available directly on the Map Viewer display); (<italic>d</italic>) display direct connections between maps by checking the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Show connections</named-content> box; (<italic>e</italic>) optionally view text in <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Verbose</named-content> or <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Condensed</named-content> mode by selecting the checkbox.

By default, a 2-kb section of sequence is shown below the representation of the features, but that limit can be increased at the bottom of the page. It is also possible to zoom and navigate in the display.</p>
              <p>Sequence Download (<named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">seq</named-content>) provides the same function as the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Download/View Sequence</named-content> link provided at the top of the Maps page. The scope of the sequence passed to the tool corresponds to what is being viewed on the page. When connected to a gene feature, the scope corresponds to that gene. The tool allows the user to alter the sequence scope and to select a report format (e.g., FASTA, GenBank, ASN.1). For the human and mouse genomes, a link is also provided to the Human&ndash;Mouse Homology Map (<named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">hm</named-content>).</p>
              <p>Model Maker (<named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">mm</named-content>) displays the evidence for exons in a genomic region by diagramming the exons predicted from the alignment of cDNAs, from <italic>ab initio</italic> models (the default), and from alignment of ESTs (after an explicit selection). To facilitate construction of your own model transcript or transcripts, the splice junctions and the exons they connect are displayed, and the coding potential of any combination of exons can quickly be evaluated using ORFfinder. The sequence can also be edited, and the results can be saved or downloaded.</p>

                <p>Dynamic links to Map Viewer can be generated by constructing URLs with arguments that define the species, chromosome, range, types of maps (with or without units), display order, number of labels, query string, how to center a display around a query result, and the type of label for the display. The most current documentation is provided in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PMGifs/Genomes/MapViewerHelp.html#URLs">online help</ext-link>. The examples in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bid.1616">Box 2</xref>, however, may illustrate the flexibility of the approach. Please note that the argument of the map in the URL is processed as an ordered list, with the order in the list controlling the left-to-right order in the display. Additional qualifiers control the display of a ruler and the range on the chromosome. If a query term is included as a part of the URL and that value cannot be identified on any of the maps in the list, that map will not be displayed.</p>

                <title>Implementation</title>
                <p>Query terms are indexed for retrieval using the Entrez system. Thus, wild cards, Boolean operators, filters, and properties are managed as for other Entrez databases.</p>
                <p>Each distinct object on the map is assigned a unique identifier that is specific to a particular build. Each object may have other secondary identifiers, such as IDs, in the sequence, Clone Repository, dbSNP, LocusLink, UniGene, or UniSTS databases. All descriptors are indexed as text. In addition, some are indexed by specific field values or by pre-identified properties, such as genes with associated diseases, SNPs with heterozygosity values in pre-defined ranges, or evidence type for genes. These field names or properties can be applied to restrict a query either in the Web-based query form or within a URL. The complete listings of current implementations for field qualifiers and properties are provided in the online help documentation.</p>
                <p>Data for each map are retrieved for display from a relational database based on the IDs returned from the Entrez query. The database is used only to support display; it is refreshed with each NCBI build or update of any other map but not to track changes from build to build. Data from previous builds are archived at NCBI, but direct access is not currently supported.</p>

              <p>Map Viewer displays represent the current synthesis of information available at the time of the data freeze (<xref ref-type="table" rid="bid.1623">Table 3</xref>). It is important to understand that the underlying data may change from build to build, as our view of a genome becomes more refined. The data presented should always be critically reviewed, with a view to assessing the reliability of the assembly and annotation.</p>
              <p>Means of reviewing reliability include: (<italic>a</italic>) noting the color coding of the contigs according to whether the sequence is draft or finished (this primarily applies to the human sequence); (<italic>b</italic>) noting the descriptions of the genes, STS, or SNPs to determine whether the element has been placed more than once; (<italic>c</italic>) checking that the STS order is the same on different maps; and (<italic>d</italic>) viewing features from different coordinate systems on the same map, e.g., showing STS features on the sequence (nucleotide coordinates), RH (cRay coordinates), and genetic maps (centiMorgan coordinates) to check for ambiguities.

              <title>Summary</title>
              <p>The task of assembling an inventory of all genes of <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> and other organisms began more than a decade ago with large-scale survey sequencing of transcribed sequences. The resulting Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) were a gold mine of novel gene sequences that provided an infrastructure for additional large-scale projects, such as gene maps, expression systems, and full-length cDNA projects. In addition, untold numbers of targeted gene-hunting projects have benefited from the availability of these sequences and the physical clone reagents. However, the high level of redundancy found among transcribed sequences, not to mention a variety of common experimental artifacts, made it difficult for many people to make effective use of the data. This problem was the motivation for the development of <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/">UniGene</ext-link>, a largely automated analytical system for producing an organized view of the transcriptome. In this chapter, we discuss the properties of the input sequences, the process by which they are analyzed in UniGene, and some pointers on how to use the resource.</p>

              <title>Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs)</title>
              <p>At a time when the genomes of many species have been sequenced completely, a fundamental resource expected by many researchers is a simple list of all of an organism's genes. A gene list, together with associated physical reagents and electronic information, allows one to begin to investigate the ways in which many genes interact in the complex system of the organism. However, many species of medical and agricultural importance have not yet been prioritized for genomic sequencing, and expressed cDNAs have provided the primary source of gene sequences. Furthermore, when the genomic sequence of an organism becomes available, a collection of cDNA sequences provides the best tool for identifying genes within the DNA sequence. Thus, we can anticipate that the sequencing of transcribed products will remain a significant area of interest well into the future.</p>
              <p>The era of high-throughput cDNA sequencing was initiated in 1991 by a landmark study from Venter and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.869">1</xref>). The basic strategy involves selecting cDNA clones at random and performing a single, automated, sequencing read from one or both ends of their inserts. They introduced the term EST to refer to this new class of sequence, which is characterized by being short (typically about 400&ndash;600 bases) and relatively inaccurate (around 2% error). The use of single-pass sequencing was an important aspect of making the approach cost effective. In most cases, there is no initial attempt to identify or characterize the clones. Instead, they are identified using only the small bit of sequence data obtained, comparing it to the sequences of known genes and other ESTs. It is fully expected that many clones will be redundant with others already sampled and that a smaller number will represent various sorts of contaminants or cloning artifacts. There is little point in incurring the expense of high-quality sequencing until later in the process, when clones can be validated and a non-redundant set selected.</p>
              <p>Despite their fragmentary and inaccurate nature, ESTs were found to be an invaluable resource for the discovery of new genes, particularly those involved in human disease processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.870">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.871">3</xref>). After the initial demonstration of the utility and cost effectiveness of the EST approach, many similar projects were initiated, resulting in an ever-increasing number of human ESTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.872">4</xref>&ndash;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.876">8</xref>). In addition, large-scale EST projects were launched for several other organisms of experimental interest. In 1992, a database called dbEST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.877">9</xref>) was established to serve as a collection point for ESTs, which are then distributed to the scientific community as the EST division of GenBank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.878">10</xref>). The EST division continues to dominate GenBank, accounting for roughly two-thirds of all submissions. The 20 organisms with the largest numbers of ESTs in the public database (as of March 7, 2002) are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="bid.859">Table 1</xref>.</p>

              <p>One avenue to gene discovery is to use a database search tool, such as BLAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.879">11</xref>), to perform a sequence similarity search against dbEST. The query for such a search would be a gene or protein sequence, perhaps from a model organism, that is expected to be related to the human gene of interest. Because clone identifiers are carried with the sequence tags, it is possible to obtain the original material to generate a more accurate sequence or to use as an experimental reagent. For many EST projects, the IMAGE consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.880">12</xref>) has been particularly instrumental in collecting the cDNA libraries, arraying the clones, and making the clones available for sequencing and redistribution.</p>
              <p>For EST sequencing to be maximally productive, certain details of the library construction require some attention. For example, normalization procedures have been used to reduce the abundance of highly expressed genes so as to favor the sampling of rarer transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.881">13</xref>). More recently, subtraction techniques have been used to construct libraries depleted of clones already subjected to EST sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.882">14</xref>). Although these techniques make it more efficient to find transcripts that are at low abundance in a particular tissue, it is possible that a small number of genes will still be missed because they are simply not expressed in tissues, cell types, and developmental stages that have been sampled.</p>
              <p>Although ESTs are a useful way to identify clones of interest and provide guidance in identifying gene structure, a full-insert sequence of cDNA clones is preferable for both purposes. High-throughput full-insert cDNA sequencing projects have been the source of over 80,000 sequence submissions accessioned to date (August 2002). The full-insert cDNA sequence can allow identification of the translation product of the sequenced transcript, as well as potentially providing evidence for gene structure. Moreover, for the investigator wanting to use the clone as a reagent, having the accurate and complete sequence of the clone's insert at hand makes complete resequencing unnecessary, if the full-insert cDNA sequencing project makes clones available. Verifying that the full-insert sequence corresponds to either the complete transcript of interest or to its complete, uncorrupted coding sequence is possible without committing laboratory resources and time to a clone that produced an EST. cDNA libraries do not generally include the entire transcript sequence; therefore, many full-insert sequences do not contain the entire transcription unit. Large transcripts (&gt;6 kb) are particularly difficult to obtain.</p>

            <sec id="bid.860">
              <title>Sequence Clusters</title>
              <p>The sheer number of transcribed sequences is extraordinary, indeed for most organisms much larger than the number of genes. A major challenge is to make putative gene assignments for these sequences, recognizing that many of these genes will be anonymous, defined only by the sequences themselves. Computationally, this can be thought of as a clustering problem in which the sequences are vertices that may be coalesced into clusters by establishing connections among them.</p>
              <p>Experience has shown that it is important to eliminate low-quality or apparently artifactual sequences before clustering because even a small level of noise can have a large corrupting effect on a result. Thus, procedures are in place to eliminate sequences of foreign origin (most commonly <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>) and identify regions that are derived from the cloning vector or artificial primers or linkers. At present, UniGene focuses on protein-coding genes of the nuclear genome; therefore, those identified as rRNA or mitochondrial sequence are eliminated. Through the NCBI <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi?">Trace Archive</ext-link>, an increasing number of EST sequences now have base-level error probabilities that are used to identify the highest quality segment of each sequence. Repetitive sequences sometimes lead to false alignments and must be treated with caution. Simple repeats (low-complexity regions) are identified using a word-overrepresentation algorithm called DUST, and transposable repetitive elements are identified by comparison with a library of known repeats for each organism. Rather than eliminating them outright, subsequences classified as repetitive are &ldquo;soft-masked&rdquo;, which is to say that they are not allowed to initiate a sequence alignment, although they may participate in one that is triggered within a unique sequence. For a sequence to be included in UniGene, the clone insert must have at least 100 base pairs that are of high quality and not repetitive.</p>
              <p>With a given a set of sequences, a variety of different sources of information may be used as evidence that any pair of them is or is not derived from the same gene. The most obvious type of relationship would be one in which the sequences overlap and can form a near-perfect sequence alignment. One dilemma is that some level of mismatching should be tolerated because of known levels of base substitution errors in ESTs, whereas allowing too much mismatching will cause highly similar paralogous genes to cluster together. One way to improve the results is to require that alignments show an approximate &ldquo;dovetail&rdquo; relationship, which is to say that they extend about as far to the ends of the sequences as possible. Values of specific parameters governing acceptable sequence alignments are chosen by examining ratios of true to false connections in curated test sets. It is important to note that the resulting clusters may contain more than one alternative-splice form.</p>
              <p>Multiple incomplete but non-overlapping fragments of the same gene are frequently recognized in hindsight when the gene's complete sequence is submitted. To minimize the frequency of multiple clusters being identified for a single gene, UniGene clusters are required to contain at least one sequence carrying readily identifiable evidence of having reached the 3&prime; terminus. In other words, UniGene clusters must be anchored at the 3&prime; end of a transcription unit. This evidence can be either a canonical polyadenylation signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.883">15</xref>) or the presence of a poly(A) tail on the transcript, or the presence of at least two ESTs labeled as having been generated using the 3&prime; sequencing primer. Because some clusters do not contain such evidence (typically, they are single ESTs), not all uncontaminated sequences in dbEST appear in UniGene clusters. Of course, alternatively spliced terminal 3&prime; exons will appear as distinct clusters until sequence that spans the distinct splice forms is submitted. With the availability of genome sequence, a more stringent test of 3&prime; anchoring is possible, because internal priming can be recognized. Clusters that satisfy this more-stringent requirement can be identified by adding the term &ldquo;has_end&rdquo; to any query. Specific query possibilities such as this one are listed under the rubric <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/query.cgi">Query Tips</ext-link> on the UniGene homepage.</p>
              <p>The UniGene Web site allows the user to view UniGene information on a per cluster, per sequence, or per library basis. Each UniGene Web page (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.861">Figure 1</xref>) includes a header with a query bar and a sidebar providing links to related online resources. UniGene is also the basis for three other NCBI resources: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/ProtEST/">ProtEST</ext-link>, a facility for browsing protein similarities; Digital Differential Display (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/ddd.cgi?">DDD</ext-link>), for comparison of EST-based expression profiles; and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/HomoloGene/">HomoloGene</ext-link>, which provides information about putative homology relationships.<fig id="bid.861"><label>1</label><caption><title>Cluster view.</title><p>A Web view of the UniGene cluster representing the human serine proteinase inhibitor gene <italic>SERPINF2</italic> is shown.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch21f1" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>

              <title>UniGene Cluster Browser</title>
              <p>The UniGene Cluster page summarizes the sequences in the cluster and a variety of derived information that may be used to infer the identity of the gene. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.861">Figure 1</xref> shows an example of such a view for the human <italic>SERPINF2</italic> gene. When available, links are provided to a corresponding entry in other NCBI resources (e.g., LocusLink, OMIM) or external databases [e.g., Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) at the Jackson Laboratory and the Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN) at the University of Oregon]. Additional sections on the page provide protein similarities, mapping data, expression information, and lists of the clustered sequences.</p>
              <p>Possible protein products for the gene are suggested by providing protein similarities between one representative sequence from the cluster and protein sequences from eight selected model organisms. For each organism, the protein with the highest degree of sequence similarity to the nucleotide sequence is listed, with its title and GenBank Accession number. The sequence alignment is described using the percent identity and length of the aligned region. Also provided is a link to ProtEST, which summarizes the UniGene protein similarities on a per protein basis.</p>
              <p>The next section summarizes information on the inferred map position of the gene. In some cases, chromosome assignments can be drawn from other databases, such as OMIM or MGI. In other cases, radiation hybrid (RH) maps have been constructed using Sequence Tagged Site (STS) markers derived from ESTs. In these cases, the UniGene cluster can be associated with a marker in the UniSTS database, and a map position can be assigned from the RH map. More recently, map positions have been derived by alignment of the cDNA sequences to the finished or draft genomic sequences present in the NCBI <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview">MapViewer</ext-link>. For example, the <italic>SERPINF2</italic> gene in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.861">Figure 1</xref> has a link to human chromosome 17 in the Map Viewer. The map is initially shown with a few selected tracks that are likely to be of interest, but others may be added by the user.</p>
              <p>Although ESTs are a poor probe of gene expression, both the total number of ESTs and the tissues from which they originated are often useful. Both of these are displayed in the cluster browser. The tissues are listed under Expression Information, which includes the tissue source of libraries of the component sequences and, for human, links to the SAGE resource. Moreover, if genomic sequence is available, the UniGene map view displays expression for each exon (more precisely, for each portion of genome similar to a transcript; because incompletely processed mRNAs are not unheard of, the presence of a transcript is insufficient to identify an exon).</p>
              <p>The component sequences of the cluster are listed, with a brief description of each one and a link to its UniGene Sequence page. The Sequence page provides more detailed information about the individual sequence, and in the case of ESTs, includes a link to its corresponding UniGene Library page. On the Cluster page, the EST clones that are considered by the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) project to be putatively full length are listed at the top, whereas others follow in order of their reported insert length. At the bottom of the UniGene Cluster page is an option for the user to download the sequences of the cluster in FASTA format.</p>

              <title>Protein Similarity Analysis</title>
              <p>The <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/ProtEST/">ProtEST</ext-link> section of UniGene allows the user to explore precomputed protein similarities for the cDNA sequences found in a cluster. The BLASTX program has been used to compare each sequence in UniGene to selected protein sequences drawn from eight model organisms: <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>, <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. These species were chosen as spanning a variety of taxonomic classes, as well as being well represented in the protein databases. To exclude proteins that are strictly conceptual translations and models, the proteins used in ProtEST are those originating from the RefSeq, SWISS-PROT, PIR, PDB, or PRF databases.</p>
              <p>The ProtEST Web site has three features: information describing the amino acid sequence; information describing the nucleotide&ndash;protein alignments; and the ability for the user to modify various display options. The sequence alignments in ProtEST are summarized in tabular form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.864">Figure 2</xref>). The first column is a schematic representation of the nucleotide&ndash;protein alignment. The width of the column represents the entire length of the protein, whereas the unaligned nucleotide sequence is represented as a thin gray line and the aligned region is represented as a thick magenta bar. The alignment representation is a hyperlink to the full alignment regenerated on-the-fly using BLAST. Other information in the table includes the frame and strand of the alignment, a link to the corresponding trace as provided in the NCBI Trace Archive, the UniGene cluster ID, the GenBank Accession number, and columns that describe the aligned region and percent identity.<fig id="bid.864"><label>2</label><caption><title>ProtEST view.</title><p>A view of protein similarities for the human <italic>SERPINF2</italic> gene, found by BLASTX searching of a selected subset of the protein database, is shown.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch21f2" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>
              <p>To further refine the view, the sequence alignments in the table can be sorted by: (<italic>a</italic>) percent identity; (<italic>b</italic>) alignment length; (<italic>c</italic>) beginning coordinate of the alignment; (<italic>d</italic>) ending coordinate of the alignment; (<italic>e</italic>) UniGene cluster ID; or (<italic>f</italic>) GenBank Accession number. It is also possible to omit various rows of the table by restricting the display to a chosen organism or by choosing a cut-off value for the percent identity of the alignment and the length of the alignment.</p>

              <title>Digital Differential Display (DDD)</title>
              <p>DDD is a tool for comparing EST-based expression profiles among the various libraries, or pools of libraries, represented in UniGene. These comparisons allow the identification of those genes that differ among libraries of different tissues, making it possible to determine which genes may be contributing to a cell's unique characteristics, e.g., those that make a muscle cell different from a skin or liver cell. Along similar lines, DDD can be used to try to identify genes for which the expression levels differ between normal, premalignant, and cancerous tissues or different stages of embryonic development.</p>
              <p>As in UniGene, the DDD resource is organism specific and is available from the UniGene <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/">Web site</ext-link> for that organism. For those libraries that have sequences in UniGene, DDD lists the title and tissue source and provides a link to the UniGene Library page, which gives additional information about the library. From the libraries listed, the user can select two for comparison. DDD then displays those genes for which the frequency of the transcript is significantly different between the two libraries. The output includes, for each gene, the frequency of its transcript in each library and the title of the gene's corresponding UniGene cluster. Results are sorted by significance, with the genes having the largest differences in frequencies displayed at the top. Libraries can be added sequentially to the analysis, and DDD will perform an analysis on each possible library&ndash;gene pair combination. Similarly, groups of libraries can be pooled together and compared with other pools or single libraries.</p>
              <p>DDD uses the Fisher Exact test to restrict the output to statistically significant differences (<italic>P</italic> &le;  0.05). The analysis is also restricted to deeply sequenced libraries; only those with over 1000 sequences in UniGene are included in DDD. These requirements place limitations on the capabilities of the analysis. Unless there are a large number of sequences in each pool, the frequencies of genes are generally not found to be statistically significant. Furthermore, the wide variety of tissue types, cell types, histology, and methods of generating the libraries can make it difficult to attribute significant differences to any one aspect of the libraries. These issues underscore the need for more libraries to be made public and the need for the comparisons to be made using proper controls. Libaries generated by the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/">CGAP</ext-link>) will become especially valuable to this end. This project has resulted in a plethora of human libraries made from a variety of tissue types and generated using a variety of methods.</p>

UniGene clusters, supplemented by data from genome sequencing projects, have been used as a source of gene sequences for automated comparisons.</p>
              <p>Homology relationships, according to the experts who judge these, have been obtained from several sources.

Ortholog pairs involving sequences from <italic>H. sapiens</italic> and <italic>M. musculus</italic> have been imported from the NCBI <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Homology/">Human&ndash;Mouse Homology Map</ext-link>. Additional information has been extracted from the literature by NCBI staff specifically for the HomoloGene project.</p>
              <p>MegaBLAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.884">16</xref>) is used to perform cross-species sequence alignments and to identify those sequence pairs that share high degrees of nucleotide similarity. For each sequence, its best alignment with the sequences of the other organisms is retained. However, the best match for a sequence is not necessarily the best match for its partner sequence. For example, if there are several more sequences representing a particular gene in one organism than in the other organism, several sequences in one organism might have the same best match in the less well-represented organism. Similarly, if there are several paralogous genes in one species, they may find one identical homologous gene in another species. HomoloGene discriminates &ldquo;one-way best matches&rdquo; from cases where two sequences are each other's best match, or &ldquo;reciprocal best matches&rdquo;, and only these reciprocal best matches are used. These sequence pairs are then used to find cross-species homologies between UniGene clusters. When reciprocal best matches are consistent between three or more organisms, the pair is described as being part of a &ldquo;consistent triplet&rdquo;.</p>
              <p>The connections made by these methods result in a complex web of relationships. To simplify the Web view, it is useful to have each report page focus on an individual gene, called the &ldquo;key gene&rdquo;, and to show connections that follow from it. An example of the report for the <italic>M. musculus Serpinf2</italic> gene is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.867">Figure 3</xref>. The title of this key gene is shown at the top of the page, followed by genes from other species that show reciprocal best match relationships to the key gene. Each of these may have hypertext links to provide additional biological information about the gene. This is followed by a section providing the curated homology information (if any), with links to the source of the data. Reciprocal best-match relationships are listed in the next two sections, first those directly involving the key gene and then those from a second round of walking that may be of interest. In each case, the description includes the sequence identifiers and percent identity of the alignment, with a hyperlink to reproduce a full alignment using BLAST.<fig id="bid.867"><label>3</label><caption><title>HomoloGene view.</title><p>Homology information for the mouse <italic>Serpinf2</italic> gene, with curated homologies for mouse and computed homologies extending to rat, zebrafish, and cow, is shown.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch21f3" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>

              <title>Summary</title>
              <p>The protein database of Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) is an attempt to phylogenetically classify the complete complement of proteins (both predicted and characterized) encoded by complete genomes. Each COG is a group of three or more proteins that are inferred to be orthologs, i.e., they are direct evolutionary counterparts. The current release of the COGs database consists of 4,873 COGs, which include 136,711 proteins (~71% of all encoded proteins) from 50 bacterial genomes, 13 archaeal genomes, and 3 genomes of unicellular eukaryotes, the yeasts <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, and the microsporidian <italic>Encephalitozoon cuniculi</italic>. The COG database is updated periodically as new genomes become available. The COGs for complete eukaryotic genomes are in preparation. The COGs can be applied to the task of functional annotation of newly sequenced genomes by using the COGnitor program, which is available on the COGs <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/">homepage</ext-link>.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The recent progress in genome sequencing has led to a rapid enrichment of protein databases with an unprecedented variety of deduced protein sequences, most of them without a documented functional role. Computational biology strives to extract the maximal possible information from these sequences by classifying them according to their <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1310">homologous</xref> relationships, predicting their likely biochemical activities and/or cellular functions, three-dimensional structures, and evolutionary origin. This challenge is daunting, given that even in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, arguably the best-studied organism, only about 40% of the gene products have been characterized experimentally. However, computational analysis of complete microbial genomes has shown that prokaryotic proteins are, in general, highly conserved, with about 70% of them containing ancient conserved regions shared by homologs from distantly related species. This allows one to use functional information from experimentally characterized proteins to suggest function in their homologs from poorly studied organisms. For such functional predictions to be reliable, it is critical to infer orthologous relationships between genes from different species. <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1362">Ortholog</xref>s are evolutionary counterparts related by vertical descent (i.e., they have evolved from a common ancestor) as opposed to <!--<glossref>-->paralogs<!--</glossref>-->, which are genes related by duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.902">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.903">2</xref>). Typically, orthologous proteins have the same domain architecture and the same function, although there are significant exceptions and complications to this generalization, particularly among multicellular eukaryotes.</p>
              <p>The COGs database has been designed as an attempt to classify proteins from completely sequenced genomes on the basis of the orthology concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.904">3</xref>&ndash;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.906">5</xref>). The COGs reflect one-to-many and many-to-many orthologous relationships as well as simple one-to-one relationships (hence, orthologous groups of proteins). In addition to the classification itself, the COGs Web site includes the COGnitor program, which assigns proteins from newly sequenced genomes to COGs that already exist and to several functionalities that allow the user to select and analyze various subsets of COGs.</p>

              <title>Construction of the COGs</title>
              <p>COGs have been identified on the basis of an all-against-all sequence comparison of the proteins encoded in complete genomes using the gapped BLAST program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.907">6</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.610">Chapter 16</xref>) after masking low-complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.908">7</xref>) and predicted coiled-coil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.909">8</xref>) regions. The COG construction procedure is based on the simple notion that any group of at least three proteins from distant genomes that are more similar to each other than they are to any other proteins from the same genomes are most likely to form an orthologous set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.888">Figure 1</xref>). This prediction holds even if the absolute level of sequence similarity between the proteins in question is relatively low, and thus the COG approach accommodates both slow-evolving and fast-evolving genes.<fig id="bid.888"><label>1</label><caption><title>Example of a COG: monoamine oxidase.</title><p>The <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/COG/palox?COG1231">COG</ext-link> for monoamine oxidase currently contains eight proteins from seven different organisms: one each from <italic>Deinococcus radiodurans</italic> (DRA0274), <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Rv3170), <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (BS_yobN), <italic>Synechocystis</italic> (slr0782), <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (PA0421), and <italic>Mesorhizobium loti</italic> (mll3668), and two paralogs from <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> (CC2793 and CC1091).

              <p>Briefly, COG construction includes the following steps:

                    <p>Perform a case-by-case analysis of each COG. This analysis serves to eliminate false-positives and to identify groups that contain multidomain proteins by examining the pictorial representation of the BLAST search outputs. The sequences of detected multidomain proteins are split into single-domain segments, and steps 1&ndash;4 are repeated with the resulting shorter sequences, which assigns individual domains to COGs in accordance with their distinct evolutionary affinities.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item id="bid.894">

                    <p>Examine large COGs that include multiple members from all or several of the genomes using phylogenetic trees, cluster analysis, and visual inspection of alignments. As a result, some of these groups are split into two or more smaller ones that are included in the final set of COGs.</p>

                </list>
              </p>
              <p>By the design of this procedure, a minimal COG includes three genes from distinct phylogenetic lineages; protein sets from closely related species were merged before COG construction. The approach used for the construction of COGs does not supplant a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis. Nevertheless, it provides a fast and convenient shortcut to delineate a large number of families that most likely consist of orthologs.</p>
              <sec id="bid.895">
                <title>The COGnitor Program</title>
                <p>New proteins can be assigned to the COGs using the COGnitor program, the principal tool associated with the COGs database. COGnitor &ldquo;BLASTs&rdquo; the query sequences against all protein sequences encoded in the genomes that are classified in the current release of the COG system. To assign proteins to COGs, COGnitor applies the same principle that is embedded in the COG construction procedure, i.e., the consistency of genome-specific BeTs. For any given query protein, if the number of BeTs for a particular COG exceeds a predefined cut-off (three by default; the cut-off value can be changed by the user), the query protein is assigned to that COG; in cases where there are more than three BeTs to two different COGs, an ambiguous result is reported.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="bid.896">
                <title>The Current State of the COGs Database, Updates, and Additional Classification of the COGs</title>
                <p>Once the COGs have been identified using the above procedure, new members can be added using the COGnitor program. The assignments are further checked and curated by hand to eliminate potential false-positives. It has been shown that 95&ndash;97% of the COGnitor assignments typically require no correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.910">9</xref>). Once the proteins from a new genome are assigned to the appropriate pre-existing COGs through this combination of COGnitor and manual refinement, the remaining proteins from this genome are compared to the proteins from non-COG proteins from previously available genomes, and an attempt is made to construct new COGs using the original procedure. In addition, when new sequences are added to an exisiting COG, the COG is examined for the possibility of a split (isolation of a new COG) by inspecting BLAST search outputs for all COG members and, in some cases, phylogenetic tree analysis. Thus, the number of COGs continuously grows through the construction of new COGs that typically include just a small number of species, whereas the number of proteins in the COG system increases primarily through the addition of new members to pre-existing COGs.</p>
                <p>In bacterial and archaeal genomes, approximately 70% of the proteins typically belong to the COGs. Because each COG includes proteins from at least three distantly related species, this reveals the generally high level of evolutionary conservation of protein sequences, making the COGs a powerful tool for functional annotation of uncharacterized proteins. The COGs were classified into 18 functional categories that loosely follow those introduced by Riley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bid.911">10</xref>) and also include a class for which only a general functional prediction (e.g., that of biochemical activity) was feasible, as well as a class of uncharacterized COGs. A significant majority of the COGs could be assigned to one of the well-defined functional categories, but the single largest class includes the functionally uncharacterized COGs. Additionally, the COGs were clustered according to the common metabolic pathways and macromolecular complexes.</p>

              <title>Phyletic Pattern Analysis in COGs</title>
              <p>A phyletic pattern is the pattern of species that are represented or not represented in a given COG; alternatively, phyletic patterns can be described in terms of the sets of COGs that are represented in a given range of species. The COGs show a broad diversity of phyletic patterns; only a small fraction are universal COGs, i.e., they are represented in all sequenced genomes, whereas COGs present in only three or four species are most abundant. This patchy distribution of phyletic patterns probably reflects the major role of horizontal gene transfer and lineage-specific gene loss in the evolution of prokaryotes, as well as the rapid evolution of certain genes in specific lineages, which may be linked to functional changes. Phyletic patterns are informative not only as indicators of probable evolutionary scenarios but also functionally; most often, different steps of the same pathway are associated with proteins that have the same phyletic pattern, whereas on some occasions, complementary patterns indicate that distinct (sometimes unrelated) proteins are responsible for the same function in different sets of species. The COG system includes a simple phyletic pattern search tool that allows the selection of COGs according to any given pattern of species. This tool effectively provides the functionality of &ldquo;differential genome display&rdquo; (for example, allowing the selection of all COGs that are present in one, but not the other, of a pair of genomes of interest) and can be helpful for delineating sets of candidate proteins for a particular range of functional features, e.g., virulence or hyperthermophily.</p>

              <title>Future Directions</title>
              <p>Substantial evolution of the COGs is expected in the near future in terms of both growth by adding more genomes and the addition of new functionalities and layers of presentation. Quantitatively, the main forthcoming addition is the COGs for eukaryotic genomes, which are expected to approximately double the size of the COG system. Many of the COGs include paralogous proteins, and this will be addressed by introducing hierarchical organization into the COG system, whereby related COGs will be unified at a higher level. In addition, partial integration of the COGs with the NCBI's Conserved Domains Database (CDD) is expected (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.94">Chapter 3</xref>), which will result in a more flexible and informative representation of the domain organization of proteins and of structural information that is available for COG members.</p>

              <title>Summary</title>
              <p>The User Services team is the primary liaison between the public and the resources and data at NCBI. User Services disseminates information through outreach training programs and exhibits at scientific conferences and responds to incoming questions by email and telephone assistance. The team instructs people in the use of NCBI resources, responds to a wide range of questions, receives comments and suggestions, and coordinates with the NCBI resource developers to implement suggestions from users. In addition, User Services develops documentation, tutorials, and other support materials; produces the NCBI News; and publishes articles on NCBI resources.</p>

              <title>The User Services Team</title>
              <p>User Services consists of a staff of scientists and information specialists with diverse backgrounds and experiences. Scientist members of the staff hold Masters or Ph.D. degrees in an area of molecular biology, biochemistry, or biotechnology. Information specialists have Masters degrees in Library and Information Science and extensive experience using online databases of scientific information.</p>

                <title>The Help Desk</title>
                <p>Help Desk assistance is available from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday. Two email addresses are available, info@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov and blast-help@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. The <email>info@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</email> address is for any type of inquiry, including questions about services; how to get started using the NCBI tools for a particular research problem; reports of technical problems; press inquiries; and comments or suggestions about NCBI resources. The <email>blast-help@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</email> address is for questions and comments regarding sequence similarity searches using BLAST tools and databases. The Help Desk phone number is 301-496-2475.</p>
                <p>email questions are answered as expeditiously as possible, usually within a day of receipt of the question. However, those that require extended investigation may take longer. Questions are usually handled directly by members of the User Services staff, although some are referred to a specific database development team for attention.</p>
                <p>Examples of question topics include: data submission protocols, including the use of <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1244">BankIt</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1398">Sequin</xref> (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.538">Chapter 12</xref>); finding summary information about a gene or disease; using <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1282">Entrez</xref> (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.588">Chapter 15</xref>) to find sequence records for genes and proteins; choosing the best <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1246">BLAST</xref> service to use for a particular application (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.610">Chapter 16</xref>); how to interpret BLAST results; how to display and manipulate three-dimensional structures with <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1264">Cn3D</xref> (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.94">Chapter 3</xref>); how to display genome data using the <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1336">Map Viewer</xref> (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1562">Chapter 20</xref>); how to print or save search output; how to set up sequence databases and install NCBI software locally; and which databases to use for a specific research question. We also accept reports of possible data errors, suggestions of new features or content to include in databases, and reports of system bugs or Web problems. The NCBI also receives a number of press inquiries about the research applications of our services, bioinformatics in general, and various genome projects. Occasionally, a high-school student will submit questions for a classroom assignment, providing a special outreach opportunity to young scientists.</p>
                <p>Because of the genetic focus of many of NCBI resources, we receive a number of questions from the general public regarding medical issues. The NCBI Help Desk staff can neither provide direct answers to medical questions nor give medical advice or guidance. However, we do provide suggestions on how to search our resources for information on the gene or condition of interest and refer users to the National Library of Medicine (NLM) customer service group for further assistance with PubMed (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.42">Chapter 2</xref>), <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/">MEDLINEplus</ext-link>, and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>. We also refer them to outside organizations that can provide information on such topics as support groups and sources of medical advice.</p>
                <p>Questions about <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1387">PubMed</xref> are handled by a separate customer service group within the NLM. Their direct address is <email>custserv@nlm.nih.gov</email>, and their phone number is 1-888-FIND-NLM. PubMed questions that are received at the NCBI Help Desk are forwarded to NLM.</p>

                    <bold>Molecular Biology Information Resources</bold>
                  </title>
                  <p>This course is designed primarily for medical and science librarians or other professionals who are providing support services for molecular biology information resources. It provides an introduction to four categories of molecular biology information available from NCBI: nucleotide sequences, protein sequences, three-dimensional structures, and complete genomes and maps. An overview of search systems available at the NCBI, particularly Entrez and BLAST, emphasizes how search skills related to other types of information resources also apply to molecular biology databases. The course concludes with a discussion of various levels of molecular biology information services provided by librarians.</p>
                  <p>The Medical Library Association approves this course for eight continuing education credit hours. The course has been given at 24 locations since May 1997. Because of the increase in NCBI services, courses are being revised and are not being scheduled at this time.</p>

                    <bold>NCBI Advanced Workshop for Bioinformatics Information Specialists</bold>
                  </title>
                  <p>A new 5-day advanced course on NCBI resources has been developed as part of a collaborative project with a group of scientists and librarians who currently provide bioinformatics support services at their universities. The course provides detailed descriptive information as well as hands-on experience with handling a wide range of user questions. The course is designed for bioinformatics support staff based in university medical libraries so that they can, in turn, assist students, faculty, staff, and clinicians at their institutions in the use of molecular biology information resources.

                    <bold>Specialized Mini-Courses</bold>
                  </title>
                  <p>The Service Desk staff also offers four mini-courses: BLAST QuickStart, Unmasking Genes in the Human Genome, Making Sense of DNA and Protein Sequences, and GenBank and PubMed Searching. Each is described briefly below. The purpose of the mini-courses is to focus on specific research application areas and address how to use multiple NCBI resources together to answer a research question. Additional problem-oriented mini-courses are under development.</p>
                  <p>The courses are 2 hours each in length. An overview is given during the first hour in lecture format, followed by a 1-hour hands-on session. Although primarily given on the NIH campus, NCBI is beginning to offer these workshops at outside institutions as well. Although the mini-courses were originally designed to be presented by an instructor, they are constructed in an online notebook format; therefore, it is possible to take the course on your own. Revisions to augment the online notebooks with lecture material and make the courses completely self-guided are currently under way.</p>

                    </title>
                    <p>This mini-course is a practical introduction to the BLAST family of sequence-similarity search programs. Exercises range from simple searches to creative uses of the BLAST programs.</p>

                      <bold>Unmasking Genes in the Human Genome</bold>
                    </title>
                    <p>This mini-course covers how to find genes, promoters, and transcription factor-binding sites in human DNA sequences. It is designed around a program developed within User Services called Greengene, which integrates the output of several gene-finding tools and allows a coding sequence and accompanying protein translation to be assembled from the exons detected by these programs. Because the output of several programs is integrated, there is increased reliability in exon selection.</p>

                      <bold>Making Sense of DNA and Protein Sequences</bold>
                    </title>
                    <p>In this course, participants find a gene within a eukaryotic DNA sequence. They then predict the function of the derived protein by seeking sequence similarities to proteins with documented function using BLAST and other tools. Finally, a 3D modeling template is located for the protein sequence using the Conserved Domain Search (CDD-Search).</p>
                    <p>During the first hour, an instructor walks the class through an analysis of an uncharacterized <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> genomic sequence from a GenBank record. During the second hour, participants perform the same analysis independently, using a different genomic sequence.</p>

                <title>CoreBio</title>
                <p>An innovative training program that began in 2001 aims to train molecular biologists for a new type of career as bioinformatics specialists who provide institutional support for users of computational biology tools. The NCBI Core Bioinformatics Facility (referred to as the CoreBio program) currently functions to train and support a network of bioinformatics specialists serving individual Institutes at NIH. NCBI's CoreBio facility trains Core members identified by their respective institutes in the use of its bioinformatics tools. The Core members, in turn, support the use of NCBI tools and databases by researchers at their institutes.</p>
                <p>The training is provided over a 9-week period, with students attending lectures and completing practical exercises in the morning and returning to their regular workplace in the afternoon. The coursework centers on one major topic each week and follows the rough schedule given below:</p>
                <p>WEEK 1: Introduction to the Sequence Databases</p>
                <p>WEEK 2: BLAST</p>
                <p>WEEK 3: The Human Genome</p>
                <p>WEEK 4: Genomic Biology</p>
                <p>WEEK 5: Molecular Modeling</p>
                <p>WEEK 6: Web Page Development</p>
                <p>WEEK 7: Setting Up a BLAST Web Server</p>
                <p>WEEK 8: Interaction with Users</p>
                <p>WEEK 9: Practicum</p>
                <p>During week 9, the students pursue an institute-related project with the assistance of NCBI instructors. These projects run the gamut from the compilation of specialized datasets and data mining to the creation of novel BLAST interfaces and the construction of new data display tools. Students also develop a Web page to support the services they are developing for the respective Institutes at the NIH.</p>
                <p>Although currently a NIH-based program, other organizations are welcome to consider using the program as a model for development of similar initiatives to meet their bioinformatics support needs.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>This chapter contains tutorials for using Map Viewer. Step-by-step instructions are provided for several common biological research problems that can be addressed by exploiting the whole-genome and positional perspectives of Map Viewer. Please be aware that the examples in these tutorials may return different results when you execute them, because the underlying data may have been updated, but we hope that the framework for obtaining, interpreting, and processing your results will be sufficiently clear if that happens. Most of the examples are for human genes, but the same logic applies to other genomes as well.</p>
              <p>Please note that each of these tutorials is accompanied by a figure. If you are using this tutorial on the Web, we suggest that you open another browser window so that you can view the figure as you are reading the text. You are also encouraged to use Map Viewer interactively.</p>
              <p>We welcome any suggestions that you have for improving the existing tutorials or for adding new ones.</p>

              <title>1. How Do I Obtain the Genomic Sequence around My Gene of Interest?</title>
              <p>There are many instances in molecular biological research when you may have only a cDNA sequence but need to have the nucleotide sequence that lies 5&prime; or 3&prime; to a gene or the introns for additional analyses. Because genomic sequence available from the public database may not have this annotation or may be so large as to make it difficult to retrieve only a region of interest, tools have been added to Map Viewer to make it easier to define, view, and download genomic sequence in multiple formats.</p>
              <sec id="bid.1681">
                <title>Direct Sequence Information via Map Viewer</title>
                <p>From the Map Viewer <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview">homepage</ext-link>, select <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Search</named-content> Homo sapiens (human) from the pull-down menu, enter FMR1 in the box labeled <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">for</named-content>, and then select <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Go</named-content>. On the results page, four entries are returned (<italic>4 hits</italic>). <italic>FMR1</italic> has been mapped on three different maps: <italic>Genes_cyto, Genes_seq,</italic> and <italic>Morbid</italic>. Select the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Genes_seq</named-content> map to see the structure of the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene. Two links to the right of the Genes_seq map are of use in retrieving the 5&prime; and 3&prime; flanking DNA, the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">sv</named-content> and <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">seq</named-content> links (<italic>boxed</italic>). At the top of the page, <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Download/View Sequence/Evidence</named-content> can also be used.</p>
                <p>The most informative maps, for the purpose of this example, are the Contig, Component, and Genes_seq maps. Selecting the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Genes_seq</named-content> map will display the current gene model. To start our search for flanking DNAs, display the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Contig</named-content> and <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Component</named-content> maps. To do so, select <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Maps &amp; Options</named-content>, and from the available maps, choose the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Contig</named-content> map by left-clicking with the mouse. Select <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">ADD&gt;&gt;</named-content>. Now add the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Component</named-content> map. Next, make the Gene_seq map the master map in the display by left-clicking on the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Gene</named-content> map under the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Maps Displayed</named-content> (<italic>left</italic> to <italic>right</italic>) and selecting <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Make Master/Move to Bottom:</named-content>. Finally, select the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Contig</named-content> map and choose the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Toggle Ruler</named-content> to add a ruler (<italic>[R]</italic>) to the display. This will guide you in finding your region of interest. Select <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Apply</named-content>. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.1682">Figure 1</xref>, we can see that FMR1 has been annotated on a finished contig, NT_011537.9 (<italic>c</italic>), and that the contig is built from two components in this region, AC016925.15 and L29074.1 [(<italic>a</italic>) and (<italic>b</italic>), respectively].<fig id="bid.1682"><label>1</label><caption><title>Making a master map.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch24f1" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>
                <p>There are two links on the Map Viewer display that are used to view and download of the region of interest: the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">seq</named-content> link and the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Download/View Sequence/Evidence</named-content> link (<italic>boxed</italic>). The <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">seq</named-content> link is displayed only when the Gene_seq map is made the master map in the display. Selecting the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">seq</named-content> link will open a window, prompting the user to enter a region to retrieve. This region can then be refined further by adjusting the position, in kilobase pairs. Selecting <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Display Region</named-content> will change the start and stop positions on the contig, where the gene has been annotated. The region can then be displayed and saved locally in FASTA or GenBank formats.</p>
                <p>Selecting the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Download/View Sequence/Evidence</named-content> link from the main display page will generate the same window, but the initial coordinates are those spanning the entire region displayed by the Map Viewer rather than the region of a particular gene, as in the case above.</p>
                <p>Let us assume that we would like to download 5.0 kb of upstream DNA and 1.0 kb of downstream DNA. To define this region, we will need to follow the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">seq</named-content> link, which will open a new display showing the chromosome coordinates for <italic>FMR1</italic> and the corresponding position on the contig. To adjust the region, simply enter the amount of desired upstream DNA and downstream DNA into the two <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">adjust by:</named-content> input boxes provided, and select <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Change Region</named-content>. Notice that the corresponding region on the contig has adjusted to reflect this change in position. Now we can either display the data in GenBank or FASTA formats and save the data to a disk.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="bid.1683">
                <title>Using the Sequence Viewer</title>
                <p>Another tool for obtaining the desired sequence is the Sequence Viewer, available via the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">sv</named-content> link when the Gene_seq map is the master map. The Sequence Viewer presents a graphical view of the gene within the contig. The sequence is also annotated with the coding regions, RNA and gene features, Sequence Tagged Sites (STSs), and single nucleotide polymorphisms. <italic>Blue arrows</italic> at the <italic>top</italic> and <italic>bottom</italic> of the display allow the user to navigate upstream or downstream. The <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Get Subsequence</named-content> link (<italic>large, open arrow</italic>) at the <italic>top</italic> of the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">sv</named-content> page allows the user to change the sequence range on the contig and will also display the reverse complement of the sequence. The specified region can then be displayed and saved locally in FASTA format.</p>
              </sec>
            </sec>
            <sec id="bid.1684">
              <title>2. If I Have Physical and/or Genetic Mapping Data, How Do I Use the Map Viewer to Find a Candidate Disease Gene in That Region?</title>
              <p>In this example, we will use the Map Viewer to look for human candidate genes in a region. The types of queries that can be posted to the Map Viewer that will address this type of question are queries by genetic marker or STS.</p>
              <p>Please note that Map Viewer supports queries by any named object positioned on a map so that it is possible to query by gene symbol or GenBank Accession number or any other object that might define your range of interest.</p>
              <sec id="bid.1685">
                <title>Querying by STSs</title>
                <p>To refine our search,  we will enter the names of two STSs. In the text box, enter &ldquo;sWXD113 OR DXS52&rdquo; on chromosome X. Select <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Find</named-content>. We can see that these two STSs map to the distal region of the long arm of the X chromosome, Xq, by the <italic>red tick marks</italic> that appear alongside the schematic of the X chromosome. These two STS markers have been mapped on several other maps that are also represented in the results. Select the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">X</named-content> chromosome <italic>above</italic> the <italic>red 3</italic> to see both markers in the same display. The Map Viewer page now displays three different maps, each showing the physical location of these two markers.</p>
                <p>The maps that are displayed include the UniG_Hs, Genes_seq, and STS maps. The UniG_Hs map shows the density of ESTs and mRNAs that align to the current assembly of the human genome. The Genes_seq map displays known and predicted genes that are annotated on the genomic contigs. The <italic>rightmost</italic> map, the STS map in this case, is termed the master map and contains descriptive information about each map element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.1686">Figure 2</xref>). The two STSs for which we are searching (<italic>GDB:192503</italic> and <italic>DXS52</italic>) are highlighted in <italic>pink</italic>. To the <italic>right</italic> of the display is a grid indicating other maps upon which these STSs are located. The <italic>red dots</italic> (<italic>circled</italic>) to the <italic>left</italic> of each highlighted STS show the relative position of these STSs in the context of the two other maps. By default, a ruler is displayed alongside the STS map so that the region of interest can be localized further. Notice on the <italic>far left</italic> of the page that there is an area where you can enter the region that you would like to display [(<italic>a</italic>)].<fig id="bid.1686"><label>2</label><caption><title>Master Map: STS.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch24f2" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>
                <p>At the current resolution, it is not possible to view all of the information displayed on the three maps. Therefore, some adjustment will be necessary.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="bid.1687">
                <title>Identifying a Candidate Gene</title>
                <p>Narrow the region further using the ruler adjacent to the STS map as a guide. It is not necessary to display a ruler alongside the other two maps because they are all on the same coordinate system. In instances where sequence, genetic, cytogenetic, or radiation hybrid maps are being displayed in the same view, it is advisable to display additional rulers because the different maps show the mapped element on different coordinate systems (Kbp, cM, banding position, or centiRays, respectively). Enter the range 133.0 M to147.0 M in the <italic>boxes</italic> to the <italic>left</italic> of the page, in the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Region Shown</named-content> [(<italic>a</italic>)]. Select <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Go</named-content>. This is a slightly better view; however, there are many more genes in the region that can be displayed.</p>
                <p>To see all of the genes in the region defined by the two markers, select the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Data as Table View</named-content> link (<italic>boxed</italic>). The table that is generated lists all 144 genes in this region in a format easily read by people or computers. The table also preserves the links to additional gene-related resources seen in the graphical display, as well as reporting other objects in your displayed region. Please note that links are also provided to make it easy for you to download reports, not only of the objects in your map display, but other objects within the region defined by your display. This feature is especially useful if you are looking for other gene markers in your region of interest.</p>
                <p>We can also change the page length under <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Maps &amp; Options</named-content> to a number large enough so that all genes are displayed graphically on a single page. By default, Map Viewer will show 20 map elements on a page. When the Genes_seq map is made the master map, there will be information at the <italic>top</italic> of the page, indicating how many genes have been labeled (<italic>n</italic> = 20) and how many genes are in the region (<italic>n</italic> = 144). To see all of the candidate genes in the specified region, go to <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Maps &amp; Options</named-content> and change the page length to the number of genes in the region (<italic>n</italic> = 144) and then select <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Apply</named-content>.</p>

              <sec id="bid.1688">
                <title>Interpreting Your Results</title>
                <p>At this point, you can now browse the description of the genes that are being displayed. Each gene or locus name is hyperlinked to LocusLink, where a detailed report about the gene or locus is provided. If the gene or locus of interest has supporting EST and mRNA data, then you can select the UniGene cluster number and link to UniGene, where more detailed information is provided about this gene, including its pattern of expression. LocusLink also provides connections to BLink and thus indirectly to reports of related proteins in the protein database and to viewers of protein structure, if your protein of interest is related to a protein for which the structure is known (see also Exercise 8 in this chapter).</p>

                <title>Other Ways to Query</title>
                <p>The example above summarizes the approach taken when defining a region of interest by entering names of markers in the query box. Gene symbols, reference SNP names, and GenBank Accession numbers for ESTs could also be used. It should also be noted that when a chromosome is displayed, you may also submit a query using the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Region Shown</named-content> boxes in the bar at the left side.</p>

              <title>3. How Can I Find and Display a Gene with the Map Viewer?</title>
              <p>In this example, we will locate and display the human gene implicated in Fragile X syndrome using the Map Viewer. We can find the gene beginning with several types of data. Refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.1691">Figure 3</xref>. For these examples, we assume you are starting from the human-specific Map Viewer. If you instead are starting from the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/">homepage</ext-link>, please remember to select &ldquo;Homo sapiens (human)&rdquo; as the species.<fig id="bid.1691"><label>3</label><caption><title>Location and display of the human gene implicated in Fragile X syndrome.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch24f3" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>
              <sec id="bid.1692">
                <title>By Gene Symbol</title>
                <p>If we are fortunate enough to know the official gene symbol for the Fragile X gene, <italic>FMR1</italic>, or an alternative symbol such as <italic>FRAXA</italic>, we can type the symbol into the search box at the <italic>top</italic> of the page and press the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Find</named-content> button. This gene has been annotated on the genome, and the gene symbol <italic>FMR1</italic> appears on the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Genes_seq</named-content>, <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Genes_cyto</named-content>, and the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Morbid</named-content> maps. To generate a Map Viewer display that includes all three maps, select the link to <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">all matches</named-content>.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="bid.1693">
                <title>By Linkage to a Disease</title>
                <p>Genes that are linked to a disease in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) are referenced on the Morbid map and can be found by searching with a disease name or phenotype. In our case, &ldquo;fragile-X&rdquo; can be used. Using this query, we pick up hits to genes related to <italic>FMR1</italic>, as well as our intended gene. Selecting the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">FMR1</named-content> link generates a display of the gene.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="bid.1694">
                <title>By Physical Marker</title>
                <p>The <italic>FMR1</italic> gene contains the STS, STS-X69962 [(<italic>b</italic>)]; therefore, we can also use the name of this STS to find it, as in the case of a gene symbol. The search yields a table of hits showing that STS-X69962 appears on the STS map. Selecting the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">STS</named-content> link gives us a Map Viewer display of the STS we found but not of the gene we sought. To get the gene into the Map Viewer display, we can add the Genes_seq map to the display. Although <italic>FMR1</italic> is located on the Genes_seq map rather than the STS map, because the coordinate systems used in different maps are synchronized, we can see the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene if we ask for the Genes_seq track in the region corresponding to the hit on the STS map. To do this, we can select the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Maps &amp; Options</named-content> link [(<italic>a</italic>)], highlight the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Gene</named-content> map from the list of <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">available maps</named-content> in the <italic>left-hand box</italic>, and select the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">ADD&gt;&gt;</named-content> button to add this map to the list of displayed maps. After selecting the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Apply</named-content> button, the Gene map is added to the Map Viewer display. Note, however, that the view is limited to a very small 200-base pair portion of the gene. This is because we are still focused on the STS returned by our initial search. To see an expanded view, we must zoom out using the zoom control located directly over the thumbnail chromosome map in the <italic>blue sidebar</italic> [(<italic>d</italic>)]. Mousing over the control indicates that we are viewing 1/10,000th of chromosome X. We can click further up on the control to view 1/1,000th of the chromosome and see most of the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene. The <italic>FMR1</italic> gene is now centered in the Map Viewer display, and our STS hit is marked in <italic>red</italic>.</p>

                <title>By Region</title>
                <p>Often, a gene is known to reside only in a particular region. Suppose that we know only that <italic>FMR1</italic> resides somewhere between markers DXS532 and DXS7389 [(<italic>e</italic>) and (<italic>c</italic>), respectively]. We can use a query containing a Boolean OR to force the Map Viewer to search for both markers simultaneously. In this case, a query to Map Viewer of &ldquo;DXS532 OR DXS7389&rdquo; generates a number of hits to various physical maps, all to a region on chromosome X, which is marked in <italic>red</italic> under the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">X</named-content> chromosome graphic. If we select the chromosome <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">X</named-content> link under the chromosome graphic, the Map Viewer display shows marker hits on several physical maps, highlighted in <italic>red</italic>, over a fairly large sequence region from about 141 to 142 megabases. To generate a tabular listing of all the genes in this region, select the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Data as Table View</named-content> link to the <italic>left</italic> of the Map Viewer display. With a genetic map, such as the Genethon map, as the master map, it is also possible to define or refine the region of display using coordinates in centimorgans. In the case of <italic>FMR1</italic>, entering a range of 176&ndash;198 into the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Region Shown</named-content> boxes generates a display of the genes falling within that range.</p>

                <p>Suppose that we have the sequence of the mouse homolog of the human <italic>FMR1</italic> gene and want to locate it on the human genome assembly. We might consult the Human/Mouse homology map at NCBI as the most direct approach for mapped genes, but let us assume that the human homolog of the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene is unmapped. In this case, we can perform a BLAST sequence similarity search with the mouse sequence to attempt to locate the corresponding human gene. We will use the mouse <italic>Fmr1</italic> mRNA sequence, taken from NCBI's LocusLink database (Accession number NM_002024), as our probe and follow the link to <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">BLAST search the human genome</named-content> located at the <italic>top</italic> of the Map Viewer search page; type the above Accession number into the BLAST form, and press the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Search</named-content> button.

In the MegaBLAST results, the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Genomic View</named-content> button near the <italic>top</italic> of the page provides an entry point into a Map Viewer display.

In the section of the table giving features on the Genes_seq map, we find that the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene extends from 141519781 to 141558823, a span of about 40,000 base pairs. We can now return  to the graphical Map Viewer display and limit our view to this region by entering this range into the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Region Shown</named-content> boxes [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.1698">Figure 4</xref>, (<italic>a</italic>)] in the <italic>blue sidebar</italic> and pressing the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Go</named-content> button.

The <italic>FMR1</italic> gene comprises 18 exons, represented by <italic>thick lines</italic>, interspersed over about 40,000 base pairs of sequence. The gene is drawn to the <italic>right</italic> of the Genes_seq track line and therefore runs from the <italic>top</italic> of the display to the <italic>bottom</italic> and is coded on the &ldquo;plus&rdquo; strand in the human genome assembly. Genes located on the opposite strand run from the <italic>bottom</italic> of the display upward and are shown to the <italic>left</italic> of the Genes_seq track. The <italic>FMR1</italic> gene is displayed in <italic>orange</italic>, which indicates that the alignment between the genomic sequence and the <italic>FMR1</italic> transcript sequences that were used to produce the gene model was not perfect; <italic>blue</italic> alignments are of the best quality. The 3&prime;-most exon (<italic>bottom inset</italic>) of the gene is exceptionally large and probably includes a significant untranslated region. To verify this, we can select the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">sv</named-content> link (<italic>boxed</italic>) to the <italic>right</italic> of the Genes_seq map to invoke the Sequence Viewer, which shows the sequence of the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene.

By using a utility called the ModelMaker, it is possible to combine the alignment evidence with the results of gene prediction to construct novel transcripts.</p>
              <p>Beginning with the standard Map Viewer display for the gene <italic>FMR1</italic>, we can display the Gscan and Genes_seq maps in parallel, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.1706">Figure 5</xref>. The GScan map shows gene predictions made by the GenomeScan program. The Genes_seq track shows the exons implied by the composite alignment of transcripts, such as NCBI mRNA RefSeqs, to the genome. There are two <italic>boxed regions</italic> in the Map Viewer display. The <italic>upper boxed</italic> region shows that the GenomeScan model for <italic>FMR1</italic> begins at a point that is part of an intron in the transcript-based model. Furthermore, there is a separate GenomScan model upstream of the first that overlaps with the initial exon of the transcript-based model. It would be of interest to investigate whether the two GenomeScan models could be fused to produce a longer transcript. In the <italic>lower boxed</italic> region, we see that the transcript-based model includes an exon lacking in the GenomeScan model. Perhaps we can create a model transcript based on the fusion of the two GenomeScan models that also includes the extra exon seen in the transcript-based model.<fig id="bid.1706"><label>5</label><caption><title>Use of ModelMaker to test alternative cDNA XSmodels based on GenomeScan predictions of mRNA alignments.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch24f5" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>
              <p>To attempt this synthesis, we first select the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">mm</named-content> link [(<italic>a</italic>)] to the <italic>right</italic> of the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene link on the Genes_seq track to invoke the ModelMaker. A number of alignments between transcript or model sequences and the genomic contig upon which <italic>FMR1</italic> lies, NT_011537 [(<italic>b</italic>)], are given at the <italic>top</italic> of the ModelMaker display, and the implied exons resulting from these alignments are shown just <italic>below</italic>, numbered sequentially in the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Putative exons</named-content> pallet. We may choose any of these exons for inclusion in our model by selecting it. We can also choose a complete set of exons from an existing alignment by selecting the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">set</named-content> link next to an alignment. Because we plan to begin with the GenomeScan model, we can select the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">set</named-content> link next to the second alignment from the <italic>bottom</italic> to start. This gives us an initial model identical to that of the GenomeScan prediction and yields, as its longest Open Reading Frame (ORF), an ORF of 600 amino acids. We can also see the second, small, GenomeScan-predicted model at the <italic>far left</italic> of the ModelMaker display. We hope to fuse this model with the larger model. The second model comprises three closely spaced exons, resembling a single exon in the display, numbered 2&ndash;4 in the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Putative exons</named-content> pallet. Selecting exons 2 and 3 adds them to the model (<italic>first boxed pair</italic> in the ModelMaker display). At this point, the longest ORF detected in the transcript has increased to 762 amino acids. If we try to include exon 4, however, we drop back to 600 amino acids because of the introduction of an internal stop codon; therefore, we can remove exon 4 from our model with another click. Finally, we can select exon 22, which is the exon from the alignment-based model that we want to include, and notice that the longest ORF detected has risen to 823 amino acids [(<italic>c</italic>)]. Because long ORFs without stop codons occur rarely by chance, this transcript model is promising. To explore further, we can select the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">ORF Finder</named-content> link to generate a graphical view of all ORFs found in the transcript, including the longest ORF, and subject the translation of the latter to a BLAST search. In this case, we find that the majority of the predicted protein matches the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene product but that we have introduced some novel peptide sequence at the amino-terminal end as well as some near the carboxy terminus.</p>
              <p>In this example, there were multiple, putative, full-length mRNAs. Please note that ESTs can be added to the display by selecting <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">add ESTs</named-content> (Figure 5, upper right-hand corner). Additional exons and splicing patterns may then be available to be considered in your model. This feature may be of particular importance if most of the evidence for splicing and exons comes from ESTs rather than complete mRNAs.</p>

Selecting the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">hm</named-content> link (<italic>boxed</italic>) to the <italic>right</italic> of the Genes_seq map leads to the human/mouse homology maps. One can choose between two slightly different variants of human genome assembly (NCBI and UCSC). Three sources of mouse mapping data are available: the Mouse Genome Database (MGD) map, Jackson Lab map, and the Whitehead/MRC Radiation Hybrid map.

                <title>By Common Annotation</title>
                <p>Consider the gene <italic>FMR1</italic>. Let us assume we do not know much about genes from this family, but we suppose (recognizing that we may have cause to regret this supposition) that they all share the common root name FMR. We start our search from the main Map Viewer page by entering FMR* (the asterisk is a wild-card symbol) into the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Search</named-content> box and pressing the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Find</named-content> button. This search results in several hits, and some obviously do not belong to the <italic>FMR1</italic> family (cytoplasmic FMR1 interacting proteins 1 and 2, FMRFAL); but two genes on chromosome X (<italic>FMR2</italic> and <italic>FMR3</italic>) and one on chromosome 17 (<italic>FMR1L2</italic>)  look promising. By selecting the chromosome X <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">all matches</named-content> link, we go to the graphical representation of the genomic region containing three FMR genes.</p>
                <p>Selecting the gene name (the rows for the FMR* query hits are highlighted) invokes a corresponding LocusLink page that serves as a portal to available information for the gene, including the precomputed results of a similarity search against the nr database. Go to the NCBI Reference Sequences section of the LocusLink page and select the BLAST Link (<named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">BL</named-content>) link. BLink displays a schematic representation of BLAST alignments with links to displays of the best hit from each organism, protein domains found in the query sequence, or sequences similar to the query that have known 3D structures.</p>
                <p>When we look at the BLAST summary for <italic>FMR1</italic>, we find neither <italic>FMR2</italic> nor <italic>FMR3</italic>. We did not expect <italic>FMR3</italic> to show up because it had not been mapped on the Genes_seq map, which suggested that its sequence is not yet known. However, why do we not see <italic>FMR2</italic>? If we use LocusLink to retrieve the Reference Sequences for the <italic>FMR1</italic> and <italic>FMR2</italic> gene products (NP_002015 and NP_002016) and perform a pairwise BLAST comparison, we find that there is no significant similarity between the two sequences. Apparently, the names of &ldquo;FMR&rdquo; genes do not reflect common sequence features but rather a physiological condition, &ldquo;fragile X mental retardation&rdquo; syndrome, associated with this gene. In this sense, the two are members of a group or family, but they show sequence similarity only in the pathological trinucleotide repeats (CGG)<sub>n</sub> that are often found upstream of their coding regions.</p>

                <title>By Sequence Similarity to a Query</title>
                <p>To see whether there are undocumented homologs of <italic>FMR1</italic> in the genome, return to the Map Viewer maps page for the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene and select the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">BLAST the Human Genome</named-content> link. Enter the Accession number for the FMR1 protein taken from the LocusLink report (NP_002015) into the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Search</named-content> window, select <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Genome</named-content> as the database, <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">tblastn</named-content> as the BLAST program, and search. A tblastn search takes a protein sequence as a query and translates a nucleotide database in all reading frames to find any coding regions, documented or undocumented, that might code for a protein similar to the query. Such a search is very sensitive because it is tolerant of differences in codon usage as well as of insertions and deletions.</p>
                <p>The results of such a search are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.1717">Figure 7</xref>. BLAST hits to regions on four chromosomes are shown in the genomic overview, indicated by <italic>small tick marks</italic>. There are 14 hits to chromosome X, clustered near the end of the q-arm. These hits are to <italic>FMR1</italic>, which is located in band Xq27.3. There are also 5 hits apiece to chromosomes 3 and 17 [(<italic>a</italic>) and (<italic>b</italic>), respectively]. These  hits are to known homologs of <italic>FMR1, FXR1,</italic> and <italic>FXR2</italic>. Selecting the links below the chromosome graphic or on the appropriate contig link in the table below leads to a graphical display of the hits on the contig, as shown in the two <italic>insets</italic>.

              <p>The Map Viewer displays a graphic representation of genomic information with links to related resources that allow it to serve as a springboard for many types of analyses.</p>
              <sec id="bid.1719">
                <title>Finding Protein Domains in a Gene Product</title>
                <p>For example, one might be interested in the domain structure of the gene product. Let us use the human <italic>FMR1</italic> gene as an example. On the main Map Viewer page, enter FMR1 into the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Search for</named-content> window and press the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Find</named-content> button. Select the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">FMR1</named-content> link to display three maps (cyto, UniG_Hs, and Genes_seq) of the <italic>FMR1</italic> locus on chromosome X. Selecting the gene name next to the gene model (<italic>FMR1</italic>) leads to the LocusLink page, which is not only a compilation of genomic, genetic, and reference data related to the gene but also a gateway to the external resources and NCBI tools and databases. The LocusLink report for <italic>FMR1</italic> is linked to precomputed BLAST results for the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene product. Selecting <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">BL</named-content> (BLink, for BLAST link) invokes a page with a schematic view of the BLAST comparison of the FMR1 protein against the non-redundant (nr) database. The BLink page lists database hits to the FMR1 protein, sorted according to their BLAST similarity scores. Results may be reformatted by selecting <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Sort by Taxonomy Proximity</named-content> to cluster hits from the same species.</p>
                <p>To see the functional domains that have been identified in the FMR1 protein, select the Conserved Domains Database (CDD) <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Search</named-content> button. The resulting page shows two hits to the KH-domain from the SMART database and one hit to the KH domain in the Pfam database. Notice that one of the SMART domain hits is a partial hit, as indicated by the <italic>jagged edge</italic> in the schematic representation.</p>

              <sec id="bid.1720">
                <title>Visualizing 3D structures</title>
                <p>We can easily see whether there exists a three-dimensional structure that includes these conserved domains. The <italic>pink dot</italic> preceding the domain name in the BLink <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Description of Alignments</named-content> section  leads to a display of the corresponding three-dimensional structure using Cn3D, the NCBI macromolecular viewer available over the Web. The Pfam and SMART domains are linked to two 3D structures (1K1G_A and 1J4W_A). The CDD page also lists other sequences that have the same domain and shows their multiple sequence alignments.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="bid.1721">
                <title>Searching for Similar Domains in Genomic Sequence</title>
                <p>Cut and paste the sequence of the KH-domain from the FMR1 protein and run a genome-specific BLAST search. We will use the tblastn program to compare the 44-amino acid sequence of the KH domain to the nucleotide sequence of the human genome. The results will show us other regions of the genome with the potential to code for this domain. Of course, we already know from the BLink page that there are some autosomal homologs, but we do not know whether they actually contain the KH RNA-binding domain. The obvious caveat is that some pseudogenes might contain the domain as well. Our tblastn search returns 4 hits, one being the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene itself on the X chromosome, and three others on chromosomes 3, 12, and 17. Select the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Genome View</named-content> button in the Genome BLAST results to see the positions of the hits on the chromosomes. One may then select the names of sequences producing significant alignments to invoke a Map Viewer display that shows the corresponding maps and report the names of the loci. As expected, hits to chromosomes 3 and 17 correspond to the autosomal homologs FXR1 and FXR2. The hit to chromosome 12 corresponds to the hypothetical protein HSPC232, and the Map Viewer display for this BLAST hit is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="bid.1717">Figure 8</xref>). The hit is to a segment of intronic sequence, rather than to an exon, and is without supporting human EST alignments. There are, however, mouse ESTs mapping to this region (<italic>lower inset</italic>), and there is also a GenomeScan model that covers the hit; therefore, the BLAST hit may indeed represent coding sequence. Selecting the <named-content content-type="book-spec-emph">Blast hit</named-content> link (<italic>boxed</italic>) leads to an alignment (<italic>upper inset</italic>) that indicates a good match between our 44-amino acid domain sequence and a protein translation of the genomic sequence. If we map this 44-amino acid sequence onto the structure of 1K1G using Cn3D, we see that it covers a module consisting of two alpha helices and a three-stranded beta sheet (<italic>leftmost inset</italic>). It appears reasonable that our domain hit may represent an exon of the <italic>HSPC232</italic> gene. To follow this line of analysis, the next step might be to produce a transcript model incorporating this new exon using the Model Maker (see the Model Maker exercise in this series).<fig id="bid.1717"><label>8</label><caption><title>BLAST hits.</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ch24f8" mime-subtype="gif"/></fig></p>

            <p>The <italic>Alu</italic> repeat family comprises short interspersed elements (SINES) present in multiple copies in the genomes of humans and other primates. The <italic>Alu</italic> sequence is approximately 300 bp in length and is found commonly in <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1323">intron</xref>s, 3&prime; untranslated regions of genes, and intergenic genomic regions. They are mobile elements and are present in the human genome in extremely high copy number. Almost 1 million copies of the <italic>Alu</italic> sequence are estimated to be present, making it the most abundant mobile element. The <italic>Alu</italic> sequence is so named because of the presence of a recognition site for the <italic>Alu</italic>I endonuclease in the middle of the <italic>Alu</italic> sequence. Because of the widespread occurrence of the <italic>Alu</italic> repeat in the genome, the <italic>Alu</italic> sequence is used as a universal primer for PCR in animal cell lines; it binds in both forward and reverse directions. The <italic>Alu</italic> universal primer sequence is as follows: 5&prime;-GTG GAT CAC CTG AGG TCA GGA GTT TC-3&prime; (26-mer).<!--only one source for sequence.

            <p>Comparative Genomic Hybidization. CGH is a fluorescent molecular cytogenetic technique that identifies chromosomal aberrations and maps these changes to metaphase chromosomes. CGH can be used to generate a map of DNA copy number changes in tumor genomes. CGH is based on quantitative two-color fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1293">FISH</xref>). DNA extracted from tumor cells is labeled in one color (e.g., green) and mixed in a 1:1 ratio with DNA from normal cells, which is labeled in a different color (e.g., red). The mixture is then applied to normal metaphase chromosomes. Portions of the genome that are equally represented in normal and tumor cells will appear orange, regions that are deleted in the tumor sample relative to the normal sample will appear red, and regions that are present in higher copy number in the tumor sample (because of amplification) will appear green. Special image analysis tools are necessary to quantitate the ratio of green-to-red fluorescence to determine whether a given region is more highly represented in the normal or in the tumor sample.</p>

          <def>
            <p>Deoxyribonucleic acid is the chemical inside the nucleus of a cell that carries the genetic instructions for making living organisms. DNA is composed of two anti-parallel strands, each a linear polymer of nucleotides. Each nucleotide has a phosphate group linked by a phosphoester bond to a pentose (a five-carbon sugar molecule, deoxyribose), that in turn is linked to one of four organic bases, adenine, guanine, cytosine, or thymine, abbreviated A, G, C, and T, respectively. The bases are of two types: purines, which have two rings and are slightly larger (A and G); and pyrimidines, which have only one ring (C and T). Each nucleotide is joined to the next nucleotide in the chain by a covalent phosphodiester bond between the 5&prime; carbon of one deoxyribose group and the 3&prime; carbon of the next. DNA is a helical molecule with the sugar&ndash;phosphate backbone on the outside and the nucleotides extending toward the central axis. There is specific base-pairing between the bases on opposite strands in such a way that A always pairs with T and G always pairs with C.</p>

          <def>
            <p>Expect value. The E-value is a parameter that describes the number of hits one can &ldquo;expect&rdquo; to see by chance when searching a database of a particular size. It decreases exponentially with the score (S) that is assigned to a match between two sequences. Essentially, the E-value describes the random background noise that exists for matches between sequences. For example, an E-value of 1 assigned to a hit can be interpreted as meaning that in a database of the current size, one might expect to see one match with a similar score simply by chance. This means that the lower the E-value, or the closer it is to &ldquo;0&rdquo;, the higher is the &ldquo;significance&rdquo; of the match. However, it is important to note that searches with short sequences can be virtually identical and have relatively high E-value. This is because the calculation of the E-value also takes into account the length of the query sequence. This is because shorter sequences have a high probability of occurring in the database purely by chance.

            <p>A flat file is a data file that contains records (each corresponding to a row in a table); however, these records have no structured relationships. To interpret these files, the format properties of the file should be known. For example, a database management system may allow the user to export data to a comma-delimited file. Such a file is called a flat file because it has no inherent information about the data, and interpretation requires additional information. Files in a database management system have more complex storage structures. <!--Flat file, Flatfile--></p>

            <p>A gap is a space introduced into an alignment to compensate for insertions and deletions in one sequence relative to another. To prevent the accumulation of too many gaps in an alignment, introduction of a gap causes the deduction of a fixed amount (the gap score) from the alignment score. Extension of the gap to encompass additional nucleotides or amino acid is also penalized in the scoring of an alignment.

It allows one to view and search an organism's complete genome, display chromosome maps, and zoom into progressively greater levels of detail, down to the sequence data for a region of interest. If multiple maps are available for a chromosome, it displays them aligned to each other based on shared marker and gene names and, for the sequence maps, based on a common sequence coordinate system. The organisms currently represented in the Map Viewer are listed in the <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PMGifs/Genomes/MapViewerHelp.html">Entrez Map Viewer help document</ext-link>, which provides general information on how to use that tool.

Also present in the DNA mixture are short oligonucleotide primers to the DNA segment of interest and reagents for DNA synthesis. PCR relies on the ability of DNA to separate into its two complementary strands at high temperature (a process called denaturation) and for the two strands to anneal at an optimal lower temperature (annealing). The annealing phase is followed by a DNA synthesis step at an optimal temperature for a heat-stable DNA polymerase. After multiple rounds of denaturation, annealing, and DNA synthesis, the DNA sequence specified by the oligonucleotide primers is amplified.</p>

            <p>Portable Network Graphics. An extensible file format for the lossless, well-compressed storage of raster images (images that are composed of horizontal lines of pixels, such as those created by a computer screen). Compression of image, media, and application files is necessary to reduce the transmission time across the web. The technique of lossless compression reduces the size of the file without sacrificing any original data, and the image after expansion is exactly as it was before compression. PNG overcomes the patent issues of GIF (Graphic Interchange Format) and can replace many common uses of TIFF (Tagged Image File Format). Several features such as indexed color, grayscale, and truecolor are supported, as well as an optional alpha-channel. PNG is designed to work well in online viewing applications and is supported as an image standard by the <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1434">WWW</xref>.</p>

QTLs are generally identified by comparing the linkage of polymorphic molecular markers and phenotypic trait measurements. The density of the linkage map is important in the accurate and precise location of QTLs; the higher the map density, the more precise the location of the putative QTL, although there is increased likelihood that false positives will be detected. Once QTLs have been mapped to a relatively small chromosomal region, other molecular methods can be used to isolate specific genes.</p>

            <p>UNIX is an operating system that was developed by Dennis Ritchie and Kenneth Thompson at Bell Labs more than 30 years ago. It allows multitasking and multiuser capabilities and offers portability with other operating systems. It comes with hundreds of programs that are of two types: integral utilites, such as the command line interpreter; and tools such as email, which are not necessary for the operation of UNIX but provide additional capabilities to the user. It is functionally organized at three levels: the kernel, which schedules tasks and manages storage; the shell, which connects and interprets user's commands, calls programs from memory, and executes them; and tools and applications, which offer additional functionality to the operating system, such as word processing and business applications. UNIX<sup>&reg;</sup> was registered by <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lucent.com/">Bell Laboratories</ext-link> as a trademark for computer operating systems.

            <p>An assignment of importance to a term in a search query. If a term in a search query is found to match a word in a document, that word is given a &ldquo;weight&rdquo;. The exact weight of the word will depend on the emphasis given to the word by the author or its position in the document. For example, a word that occurs in a chapter title will have a higher weight than the same word if it occurs in the body of the chapter. Similarly, words that occur in data collections are also assigned weights, depending on how frequently the terms occur in the collection. <!--Protein weight matrix: the scoring table which describes the similarity of each amino acid to each other.

          <def>
            <p>Whole Genome Shotgun sequence. In this semi-automated sequencing technique, high-molecular-weight DNA is sheared into random fragments, size selected (usually 2, 10, 50, and 150 kb), and cloned into an appropriate vector. The clones are then sequenced from both ends. The two ends of the same clone are referred to as mate pairs. The distance between two mate pairs can be inferred if the library size is known and has a narrow window of deviation. The sequences are aligned using sequence assembly software. Proponents of this approach argue that it is possible to sequence the whole genome at once using large arrays of sequencers, which makes the whole process much more efficient than the traditional approaches.</p>

            <p>Extensible Markup Language. XML describes a class of data objects called XML documents and partially describes the behavior of computer programs that process them. XML is a subset of SGML, and XML documents are conforming SGML documents. XML documents are made up of storage units called entities, which contain either parsed or unparsed data. Parsed data is made up of characters (a unit of text), some of which form character data, and some of which form markup. Markup includes tags that provide information about the data, i.e., a description of the structure and content of the document. Character data comprises all the text that is not markup. XML provides a mechanism to impose constraints on the storage layout and logical structure.</p>

            <p>Extensible Stylesheet Language. XSL is used for the transformation of XML-based data into HTML or other presentation formats, for display in a web browser. This is a two-part process. First, the structure of the input XML tree must be transformed into a new tree (e.g., HTML), allowing reordering of the elements, addition of text, and calculations&mdash;all without modification to the source document. This process is described by <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1437">XSLT</xref>. Second, XSL-FO (XSL Formatting Objects, an XML vocabulary for formatting) is used for formatting the output, defining areas of the display page and their properties. In this way, the source XML document can be maintained from the perspective of &ldquo;pure content&rdquo; and can be separated from the presentation. An XML document can be delivered in different formats to different target audiences by simply switching style sheets.</p>

            <p>Extensible Stylesheet Language: Transformations. XSLT is a language for transforming the structure of an XML document. XSLT is designed for use as part of <xref ref-type="other" rid="bid.1436">XSL</xref>, the stylesheet language for XML. A transformation expressed in XSLT describes a sequence of template rules for transforming a source tree into a result tree; elements from the source tree can be filtered and reordered, and a different structure can be added. A template rule has two parts: a pattern that is matched against nodes in the source tree; and a template that can be instantiated to form part of the result tree. This makes XSLT a declarative language because it is possible to specify what output should be produced when specific patterns occur in the input, which distinguishes it from procedural programming languages, where it is necessary to specify what tasks have to be performed in what order. XSLT makes use of the expression language defined by XPath (a language for addressing the parts of an XML document) for selecting elements for processing, for conditional processing, and for generating text.</p>
