         <p class="para">This section describes each element in the OASIS (CALS) Table Exchange table model. Although the elements are declared in
            different modules, they are described in alphabetical order of their tag names
             (i.e., element type names). The tag name is the shorter machine-readable name used in
             tagged documents, DTDs and schemas, and by software; for example, the
             tag name <a href="n-kx00.html"><span class="elementtag">&lt;oasis:row&gt;</span></a> is used for the element named
             <a href="n-kx00.html"><span class="elementname">Table Row (OASIS Table Model)</span></a>.
         </p>
         <p class="para">Each element is described by a separate HTML page, where the heading for the page displays the element&#8217;s tag name followed
            by its longer descriptive name. The rest of the element description page discusses aspects of the element and its usage. These
            sections within the page always appear in the following order, although any given element description may not contain all
            the sections:
