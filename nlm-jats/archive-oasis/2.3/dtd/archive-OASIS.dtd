                        Interchange DTD Suite library. Thus it does
                        NOT declare itself; the DTD-specific 
                        module-of-modules; any DTD-specific class,
                        mix, or model over-ride modules; or any new
                        new content modules specific to this DTD.
                        Those are declared in the DTD-specific
                        module of modules.
                           Since this module declares but does not
                        invoke modules, this DTD then invokes any
                        modules it uses by referencing the external 
                        Parameter Entities defined in the Module of
                        Modules. To include a set of elements (such 
                        as all the lists or the MathML elements) this 
                        module defines the external Parameter Entity
                        for the module(s) that contains the MathML
                        declarations and the DTD references that 
                        entity.                                    -->

                        What kind of article is this?  
                        Note: When the article is a commentary on 
                        another article, for example a correction or
                        addendum, this attribute is metadata for the 
                        commentary itself, it does NOT define the 
                        kind of article that is being corrected or
                        amended.

                        an article type should be identified if

             dtd-version 
                        Which version of the DTD does this article
                        use? The value is a #FIXED attribute, so
                        the entire attribute definition is defined
                        in a Parameter Entity, so the next version
                        of the DTD can use a different #FIXED value.
             xml:lang   The language in which the value of the
                        element is expressed.  Recommended best 
                        practice is to use values as defined in
                        RFC 1766, typically 2-letter language
                        codes such as "FR" (French), "EN" (English),
                        and "DE" (German).  These values are NOT
                        case sensitive, so "EN" = "en". The values
                        may include hyphenated differentiations such 
                        as "EN-AU" (Australian English) and "EN-US"
                        (United States English).
                        Processing and Conversion Note: All other
                        xml:lang attributes within the article
                        inherit the value set on <article> unless
                        explicitly set themselves with their own
                        "xml:lang" attribute.                      
             xmlns      Set up the pseudo-attributes for the
                        namespaces for any namespaces used in this
                        DTD.  XLink and MathML are set up in the
                        MathML modules. These xmlns are called
                        here because certain older tools will not
                        work properly with namespaces unless they
                        are declared on the top level element.
                        The PEs are defined in the MathML modules. -->

                        original article.     
                        Conversion Note: This construction can also
                        be used for the pathological case, rarely
                        seen, in which several responses to an 
                        article are lumped together into a single
                        container which is not the original article,
                        merely a collection of responses. In one
                        example we examined, the first two responses
                        were to an original article which was else-
                        where and the third response was a response
                        to the first two responses.                -->

                                     This is the most commonly used

                        describe cases in which a series of articles
                        is chained together: typically as an 
                        introduction to the article, an article, then
                        several responses to the article.

                        referenced  
             xml:lang   The language in which the value of the
                        element is expressed.  Recommended best 
                        practice is to use values as defined in
                        RFC 1766, typically 2-letter language
                        codes such as "FR" (French), "EN" (English),
                        and "DE" (German).  These values are NOT
                        case sensitive, so "EN" = "en". The values
                        may include hyphenated differentiations such 
                        as "EN-AU" (Australian English) and "EN-US"
                        (United States English).
