1. ETAL - Changed the content model of <etal> to replace the
entier content model with a Parameter Entity, not just name some   
elements that may mix with #PCDATA. Rationale: The Authoring DTD   
would like to make <etal> EMPTY.                                  -->

<!--                    ELECTRONIC LOCATION IDENTIFIER             -->
<!--                    Used to identify an article that 
                        does not have traditional page numbers. 
                        For a printed article, when citations are 
                        sent through the Medline matcher to be turned
                        into live links or when the metadata about an
                        article is collected for complete
                        identification,  the first page number (and 
                        sometimes  also the last page number) of the 
                        article is recorded to help indicate which
                        article is being referenced. Electronic only
                        journals have no page numbers, so this
                        element is used as the equivalent identifier,
                        the "electronic page number" that helps to
                        identify the article. The value could be an 
                        article identifier, a doi, etc., for 
                        example, "E70".                        
                        Remarks: This element is more accurately an
                        electronic identifier, and it was considered
                        renaming this element to that. The purpose
                        of the name is to be a parallel with the
                        <fpage>...<lpage> model. When neither first
                        page or last page is appropriate, because
                        the electronic journal has no pages, the
                        <elocation-id> element is used instead.    -->

<!--                    A citation is a description of a work, such

                        It is better practice to tag the year
                        and month as numbers with a date such
