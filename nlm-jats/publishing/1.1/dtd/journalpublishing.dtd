<!-- MODULAR DTD LIBRARY
                        A set of journal archiving and interchange 
                        DTD modules was written as the basis for 
                        publishing, interchange, and repository 
                        DTDs, with the intention that DTDs for 
                        specific purposes, such as this Publishing 
                        DTD, would be developed based on them.
                        
                        This publishing DTD has been optimized for 
                        the creation of new journal articles. This 
                        means that it is far smaller (fewer elements,
                        and fewer choices in many contexts) than was
                        the interchange DTD. Where in the interchange
                        DTD there may have been several ways to 
                        express the same information, only one is 
                        provided for authoring. It was not the 
                        intention to limit the expressive power 
                        licensed by the DTD, but rather to limit the 
                        meaningless choices needed in a full 
                        archiving and interchange DTD that make 
                        conversion from a wide variety of formats as 
                        easy as possible.               
                        
                        This Publishing DTD has been developed from
                        the Archiving and Interchange DTD Suite
                        modules, in the approved manner, making 
                        changes to the declarations in those modules 
                        by overriding Parameter Entity contents 
                        using the  
                           %journalpubcustomize.ent;
                        module, which is called from this DTD file. 
                        No changes to any of the original Archiving 
                        and Interchange Suite modules are required 
                        in order to use this DTD.                  -->

<!-- THE MANY ROADS NOT TAKEN
                        In the interest of getting a version of this
                        DTD into production as quickly as practical,
                        several structures and functions that might
                        be appropriately included have been delayed 
                        until a future version of this DTD. Such 
                        components include:
                          - Questions and Answers (These may be 
                              modeled with the current DTDs by using 
                              paragraphs and lists)
                          - Continuing Medical Education material
                             (which frequently contains questions 
                             and answers)
                          - Forms and fill-in-the-blank
                          - Conflict of Interest statements and
                              Financial Disclosure (May be modeled
                              as paragraphs or footnotes)
                          - Electronic and Digital Rights Management
                          - Advertising included in the journal:
                                + Job ads
                                + Classified advertising
                                + Display advertising
                          - Calendars, meeting schedules, and 
                              announcements.  (These can be handled 
                              as ordinary articles or sections within
                              articles)

                              Editorial or advisory boards, detailed
                              indicia, etc.

                        Which version of the DTD does this article
                        use? The value is a #FIXED attribute, so
                        the entire attribute definition is defined
                        in a Parameter Entity, so the next version
                        of the DTD can use a different #FIXED value.
             xml:lang   The language in which the value of the
                        element is expressed.  Recommended best 
                        practice is to use values as defined in
                        RFC 1766, typically 2-letter language
                        codes such as "FR" (French), "EN" (English),
                        and "DE" (German).  These values are NOT
                        case sensitive, so "EN" = "en". The values
                        may include hyphenated differentiators such 
                        as "EN-AU" (Australian English) and "EN-US"
                        (United States English).

                        xml:lang attributes within the article
                        inherit the value set on <article> unless
                        explicitly set themselves with their own
                        "xml:lang" attribute.                      
             xmlns      Set up the pseudo-attributes for the
                        namespaces for any namespaces used in this

                        MathML modules. These xmlns are called
                        here because certain older tools will not
                        work properly with namespaces unless they
                        are declared on the top level element.

                        What kind of response is this?
                        Note: This does NOT define the kind of
                        article on which the response is commenting,
                        it is metadata for the response itself.

                        to be encouraged.  It was added to allow for
                        observed cases of a series of articles
                        being chained together as an introduction,
                        an article, and several responses.          
             xml:lang   The language in which the value of the
                        element is expressed.  Recommended best 
                        practice is to use values as defined in
                        RFC 1766, typically 2-letter language
                        codes such as "FR" (French), "EN" (English),
                        and "DE" (German).  These values are NOT
                        case sensitive, so "EN" = "en". The values
                        may include hyphenated differentiators such 
                        as "EN-AU" (Australian English) and "EN-US"
                        (United States English).
