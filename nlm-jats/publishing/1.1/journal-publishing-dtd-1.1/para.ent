     Version 1.1                           (TRG) v1.1 (2003-11-01)
      
  3. Added attribute "content-type" to elements <p>, <speech> and 
     <statement>.  
     Rationale: To identify and preserve the semantic intent of 
     semantically rich source documents.
     
  2. Added ID attribute to elements <p>, <speech>, <disp-quote>,
     and <verse-group>. 
     Rationale: Provide unique identifier so these elements can be 
     linked to.
