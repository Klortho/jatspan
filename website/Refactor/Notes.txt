NLM JATS Refactoring Suggestions

Conventions:
  - "zip" is lowercase.  "zip file" is two words, no hyphen or dot.
  - Use "he/she", "his/her".
  - "DocBook" - camel caps.
  - "system identifiers" and "public identifiers" (or "formal public
    identifiers".


To do:
  - Prepare a "download" -- a released set of files.
  - Need to check that each file is where it belongs based on the text of
    it's public id -- that is, does it make sense?
  - How is it that the number of public ids dropped from 310 in PubIdReport.xml to
    290 in JatsReport-rev77.xml?
