            <p>
              This site is a place where you can search for, upload, share,
              and collaborate on JATSPacks.  A JATSPack is a package, in a
              specified format, which provides some functionality related
              to the Journal Article Tag Suite (JATS).
            </p>
            <p>
              This site is in a very rudimentary stage at present.  The concepts
              of JATSPacks and of this JATSPAN website, and the
              rationale and the goals behind them, are described in
              <a href='docs/Balisage2011Paper/Bal2011malo0713.html'>this paper</a>
              which was presented at <a href='http://www.balisage.net/'>Balisage
              2011</a>.
              That paper is rather long, though, so you might prefer to start
              with the <a href='#quick'>quick introduction</a>, below.
            </p>
            <p>
              The eventual goal is that this JATSPAN infrastructure will provide:
            </p>
            <ul class='long'>
              <li>
                A repository of JATSPacks, and a website allowing you to
                search for and download the ones appropriate for your needs, as
                well as the ability to upload and share ones that you have
                created.
              </li>
              <li>
                A client application <em>jatspan</em>, which will enable you
                to maintain a local installation of JATSPacks.
              </li>
              <li>
                A set of RESTful web services for validating instance documents
                against uploaded JATSPacks, running automated tests, etc.

                  JATS is a set of XML schemas used in publishing scientific
                  literature.  The originated at the <a href='http://nlm.nih.gov/'>National
                  Library of Medicine</a>, in association with the
                  <a href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/'>PubMed Central archive</a>,
                  but have recently been adopted by NISO as an
                  <a href='http://www.niso.org/apps/group_public/download.php/6135/z39-96-dsftu-final.pdf'>official

                <p>
                  JATSPack is a packaging format based on the
                  <a href='http://www.expath.org/modules/pkg/'>EXPath Packaging
                  System specification</a>. JATSPack provides a well-defined way
                  of packaging customizations and libraries associated with any
                  of the JATS schema.  JATSPacks are similar to plug-ins,
                  which can be easily integrated into XML processing systems to
                  provide customizations and enhancements.
                </p>
                <p>
                  JATSPacks can include schema customizations and/or code
                  libraries.  They are designed to make it easier to extend
                  or customize the JATS schemas, while at the same time not
                  sacrificing the ability to exchange document instances.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This JATSPAN website provides a venue to allow for users to
                  openly collaborate on and share JATSPacks.

                  Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting

                  ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of
                  type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
