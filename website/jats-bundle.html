              To use it, unzip it to any directory on your filesystem, and point
              your XML toolset to the root catalog.xml file.  For example,
              To set up oXygen to use this catalog file, so that you can validate instance
              documents against any of the JATS DTDs, select "Options" → "Preferences".
              Then, in the tree on the left, "XML" -> "XML Catalog". Then add the main
              catalog.xml file from the jatspacks directory where you unzipped the bundle.

            <p>
              The goal of this bundle is to make it very easy to set up an XML
              system that can recognize and use any of the various official
              versions of the JATS.
            </p>
            <p>
              The NLM provides each one of the above
              flavors/versions of JATS as a separate downloadable Zip file
              (NLM JATS from <a href='ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/archive_dtd/'>here</a>
              and NISO JATS from <a href='ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/jats/'>here</a>).
              So, to set up a system that supports all of them requires that the
              user undergo a tedious
              process of downloading and extracting almost thirty Zip files,
              and then reconciling the OASIS catalog files that come with them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, there is considerable overlap and redundancy among the Zip
              files that you get from NLM.
              Each DTD version on the NLM FTP site is downloadable as a single Zip
              file, which includes all of the files required for that version,
              including all the library and core files that the version depends on.
              This is suitable for someone who is only interested in downloading
              and playing with one or two different versions.
              Unfortunately, however, this method of distribution makes it
              difficult to implement a single system that's capable of processing
              instance documents that conform to <em>any</em> of the many different
              flavors and versions of JATS.
            </p>
            <p>
              One problem is that there are a lot of duplicate files, and
              there are overlapping OASIS catalog files that each try to resolve a given
              public identifier to different instances of the files.  Often, the files are
              different.
              If the same public identifier is used in multiple catalog files on one
              system, and point to document instances which are not identical, it
              is difficult and tedious for someone configuring the system to sort
              out whether the differences are substantive, and if so, which is the
              correct instance.
            </p>
            <p>
              The JATS Bundle eliminates this redundancy, factors shared modules out
              into a core package, cleans up some ambiguities and inconsistencies,
              and fixes a few arcane and minor (but genuine) problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, OASIS catalog files are provided that unambigously resolve
              all of the public identifiers.  These catalog files are fully relocatable,
              so you can install the bundle to any location on your system without
              any extra work (this is another improvement over the NLM distributions).
              A top-level catalog file is provided that hierarchically includes all
              of the others.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, all that is needed to set up a system to understand
              all of these JATS flavors and versions is to unzip the bundle, and then
              point your XML toolset to the top-level OASIS catalog file.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to the core DTDs and OASIS catalog files, the bundle includes
              sample instance documents for each of the top-level DTDs.  An automatic
              test script (written in Perl, in the jatspacks/test directory) is included
              that checks that each of these sample documents validates against the
              DTDs in the bundle, both with and without the use of the catalog files.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, to bring these into alignment with the JATSPack specification,
              a package descripter file for each of the main flavors/versions has
              added.  This file is named 'expath-pkg.xml', and resides in the root directory of every individual package directory.  The bundle is
              "jatspan-ready", meaning that it should be
              the basis for a local jatspan repository, when that is eventually deployed,
              as described in the
              <a href='docs/Balisage2011Paper/JATSPackPaper.html'>Balisage paper</a>.

        <div class="post">
          <h4 id='quick' name='quick'>Are these the same as the NLM
          distributions?</h4>
          <div class="contentarea">
            <p>
              If the question is, "Are the data models described by these DTDs
              exactly the same as those from the NLM?", then the answer is "Yes!".
              Unless I have inadvertently overlooked something, or introduced a bug,
              then any document that validates to an
              NLM distribution of the DTD will
              validate to the JATSPAN distribution of the same version, and any
              document that is invalid according to NLM will be invalid according to
              JATSPAN.
            </p>
            <p>
              They are also identical in most other respects.  The implementation was
              not changed in terms of which module files (.dtd and .ent) make up
              any given DTD.  All the existing modularity, and layering of parameter
              entity definitions, is completely preserved.
            </p>
            <p>
              The actual physical differences in the files were kept to a minimum,
              and are related to
              getting all the different versions and
              flavors of the DTDs to coexist together unambiguously on one system.
              These include eliminating redundant copies of files, moving shared files
              into different directories, and fixing the relative system-id links
              between files that refer to each other, so that these references don't
              break.  There was also work done to clean up
              discrepencies among the versions, and
              fixing a few problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Note that I am in the process
              of making a detailed list of all of the
              specific changes that were made, and I will put it here as soon
              as it is finished.</em>  I would hope that before anyone suggests
              that this packaged distribution should not be used, because it is
              different, that they would first look over the differences, and
              let me know if they think there would have been a better way to
              accomplish the goal of having all these DTDs cohabitate nicely
              together in a robust and predictable way.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am committed to making sure that this bundle does provide
              a completely faithful package of the JATS DTDs.
              I have done extensive testing to ensure that this is the case.
              If by some small chance some incompatibility has snuck in, please
              tell me about it, and I will correct it immediately!
