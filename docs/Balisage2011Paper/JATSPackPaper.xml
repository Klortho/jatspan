  <title>JATSPack and JATSPAN, a packaging format and infrastructure for the NLM/NISO
    Journal Archiving Tag Suite (JATS)</title>
  <info>
    <abstract>
      <para>The NISO Journal Archiving Tag Suite (JATS, formerly known as ‘the NLM DTD’) is a
        common format used in
        publication of scientific literature. JATSPack, a proposal based on the new <link
          xlink:href="http://www.expath.org/modules/pkg/">EXPath Packaging System</link>,
        provides a way to package schema customizations and software
        libraries associated with any of the JATS schemas, thus making it easier for developers
        to distribute JATS-related resources and easier for users to acquire, install, and use them.
        <link xlink:href="http://jatspan.org/">JATSPAN</link> (the JATSPack Archive Network) is
        a website allowing users to share and collaborate on JATSPacks. A client-side command
        line tool, <code>jatspan</code>, interacts with the site and eases the task of
        maintaining local repositories of JATSPacks. </para>

    <title>Background</title>
    <para> "JATS", the <link xlink:href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/">Journal Article Tag Suite</link>,
      is a relatively new name given to the <link xlink:href="http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/">NLM Journal
        Archiving and Interchange Tag Suite</link>, which is a set of XML schemas used in the
      publishing of scientific literature. These schemas originated initially to meet the needs of
        <link xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PubMed Central</link>, for archiving and
      presenting journals and articles, and have grown to become widely used
      throughout the scientific publishing industry. </para>
    <para> JATS was recently released as a <link

      and come in several flavors<footnote xml:id='foot-flavors'>

        "Flavor" is my term, which I haven't heard used anywhere else.  I will use it throughout
        this paper to describe one of the main categories of JATS.   One "flavor" roughly corresponds
        to one top-level DTD file, which might itself have several versions.  In a detailed accounting,
        there are currently seven flavors:

        <para>
          This is somewhat complicated by the fact that the NISO standard versions of JATS
          use a different version numbering scheme, and so should also be considered
          separate flavors, even though they are really just newer versions of the existing
          NLM DTDs.
        </para>
      </footnote>, which have different semantics and use cases. These
      include Archiving and Interchange (green), Journal Publishing (blue), and Article
      Authoring (pumpkin). They also come in three different formats: DTD, W3C Schema, and Relax NG.
      Most publishers who use the JATS choose to use the DTD format (<xref linkend="C"/>).
      Although they are still
      often referred to as the "NLM DTDs", this paper will use the terms "JATS" and "JATS schemas", to
      be clear that: A) the standard is now NISO, and is no longer specifically issued by
      the NLM; and B) it is not just DTDs, but also other schema formats.  One unfortunate aspect of
      the JATS acronym is that the tag suite is not limited to Journal Articles, but can be used for
      other types of documents (books, for example).

  <section xml:id='intro'>
    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para> This paper describes JATSPack, which is a packaging format based on the new <link
        xlink:href="http://www.expath.org/modules/pkg/">EXPath Packaging System specification</link>.
      JATSPack provides a well-defined way of packaging customizations and libraries associated with
      any of the JATS schema. JATSPacks are bundled packages of catalog files, schema,
      documentation, code, and sample files, all with a coherent purpose. The JATSPack format was
      primarily designed to facilitate the exchange and reuse of JATS customizations, but it could
      also be used to package and transfer code libraries — for example, XSLT transformations to
      translate JATS to/from some other format. JATSPack can be thought of as a format for
      plugin modules, with each
      plugin providing a bundle of new functionality which can be easily installed into an XML
      toolset. </para>
    <note>
      <para>
        JATSPack and JATSPAN are not part of the NLM/NISO JATS.
        JATSPack is a proposed specification that is completely independent of the tag suite.
        JATSPAN is a non-commercial web site with no affiliation with
        <link xlink:href='http://www.nlm.nih.gov/'>NLM</link> or
        <link xlink:href='http://www.niso.org/'>NISO</link>.
      </para>
    </note>
    <para> JATSPack specifies a directory structure and a package descriptor file format.
      The package descriptor file, similar to a manifest file in other packaging formats,
      describes the contents, metadata about the included resources, and the dependencies of the
      pack. </para>

    <para> Establishing this format will facilitate the automatic installation and
      maintenance of libraries and of schema extensions, which should allow easier reuse and
      interchange of the schema themselves.  This, in turn, should allow for easier interchange
      of JATS document instances.
    </para>

    <para> <link xlink:href="http://jatspan.org/">JATSPAN</link>, the JATSPack Archive Network,
      is a website similar in
      concept to the very successful <link xlink:href='http://www.cpan.org/'>CPAN</link>
      (Comprehensive Perl Archive
      Network). Its main purpose is to allow users to share and collaborate on JATSPacks.
      Authors can upload their customizations or libraries, and can search for and
      download JATSPacks produced by
      others.  Every JATSPack can be downloaded in one of two formats.  The contents are
      exactly the same, but the download files differ in their filename extension:  a .xar file,
      which is the extension used by the EXPath Packaging System, or as a .zip file, so that the
      package can be used stand-alone, without any special infrastructure.
    </para>
    <para>
      Providing a centralized repository like this will make it easier to discover
      packs that might be relevant to one's needs, as well as making it easier to install and manage
      them on the local system. </para>
    <para> Associated with JATSPAN is a command-line client, <code>jatspan</code> (lowercase),
      which runs on a user's machine and
      maintains a local on-disk repository. <code>jatspan</code> has a
      simple interface and lets users look up and install packages from JATSPAN. One benefit
      to this architecture is that dependencies between packs can be resolved automatically. For
      example, if users want to install packs that depend on others, they don't have to
      figure out where to go to get these, and then, perhaps, be frustrated by different
      directory structures and installation requirements. Instead, the dependency packs are
      found, downloaded, and installed automatically. </para>
    <para> The software and the baseline set of data files for these are being developed in the
      <link xlink:href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/jatspan/">"jatspan" open source project on
        SourceForge</link>. </para>
  </section>


  <section xml:id='why'>
    <title>Use Cases</title>
    <para> The following are a few examples of use cases that these specifications are designed to
      address. </para>

    <section xml:id='why-1'>
      <title>A publisher installs support for a third-party JATS customization</title>
      <para> Suppose a publisher wants to integrate support for document instances that conform to
        some customization of JATS that was not developed in-house. Very often, document instances,
        if they even have a document type declaration (doctype decl) at all,
        do not include an absolute
        system identifier (a URI) to reference the DTD.
        So, at a minimum, either an OASIS catalog entry must be
        added to a local catalog file to cross reference the formal public identifier
        (FPI) to the DTD served somewhere on the Internet, or the DTD
        must be downloaded and installed on the local filesystem, and the XML processors be made
        aware of it. This is not especially difficult, but does require a certain level of expertise
        and coordination of system resources. </para>
      <para> If the customization were packaged in the JATSPack format, then the
        necessary setup would be more automated. It would be as easy as identifying the desired
        pack and using the <code>jatspan</code> utility to install it in the local repository.
        The <code>jatspan</code>
        utility automatically updates the local OASIS catalog file with a <code>&lt;nextCatalog&gt;</code>
        entry to
        point to the new JATSPack. So <emphasis role='ital'>any tool</emphasis> that is able to use
        OASIS catalogs to resolve
        identifiers would automatically get access to the new schema files without any additional
        work.</para>
      <para>
        The important point here is that, because of the way the JATSPack format incorporates
        OASIS catalog files, this system can be used with any XML processing tool, not just ones
        that are JATSPack-aware.  This is tested and works right now for both
        <link xlink:href='http://www.oxygenxml.com/'>the oXygen XML editor</link> and the
        <link xlink:href='http://xmlsoft.org/'>libxml2 library</link>.</para>
      <para>
        This use case is described in more detail in the <link linkend='taxpub'>TaxPub
        example</link>, below. </para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id='why-2'>
      <title>A developer writes a new translator, and shares it with others</title>
      <para> In this use-case, suppose that a developer that has written a
        transformation from JATS into a new file format. It could be someone who did it for fun or,
        perhaps, a company has a vested interest in promoting the file format.
        For whatever reason, let's say that they want to share it with others and try to
        get others to adopt it and integrate it into their systems.
      </para>
      <para>
        Right now, there is no standard way to
        present this transformation library to the world. Typically, the library would be presented
        for download on the developer's website, as a Zip file, with a README file that includes
        instructions for unpacking and installation.  The actual details of packaging the
        library, finding a place to put it, and letting others know about it, involve a lot of
        detailed decisions.  Each individual step is not difficult, but taken together, they
        present a barrier to this kind of sharing of code libraries.
      </para>
      <para>
        All this is ripe for standardization.  Indeed, this is the main <emphasis role='ital'>raison d'etre</emphasis>
        for the EXPath Packaging specification.
        The transformation languages in which these
        are usually written, XSLT, XQuery, and XProc, are mature enough that they can be written in
        a portable, system-independent way.
        The JATSPack format is specified and JATSPAN provides many examples, which reduces the
        burden of making decisions about how exactly to package the bundle.
        JATSPAN provides a publically-accessible place to upload packages, so developers
        don't have to find places on their own websites for them.
        If a library were created as a JATSPack, and were put
        on JATSPAN, it would be easier for potential users to discover and install.
        If this
        library had dependencies on others, then those others would not have to be bundled with
        this package. The
        <code>jatspan</code> client program would take care of resolving these dependencies automatically. </para>
      <para> This use case is discussed in more detail in the
        <link linkend='epub-transformation'>EPub Transforms example</link>, below. </para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id='why-3'>
      <title>A publisher evaluates JATS for the first time</title>
      <para>
        A publisher or a developer who is introduced to the JATS for the first time
        can be a bit overwhelmed.  To be sure, JATS is extremely well documented,
        as one can readily see by browsing the
        <link xlink:href='http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/'>NLM web site</link>.
        Yet the fact that JATS have been in use for a long time, and that there are
        now many different branches (flavors) and versions, can make them seem,
        to someone who is not familiar with them, complicated.
      </para>
      <para>
        Someone who wants to evaluate the suitability of JATS for their particular
        needs might want to be able to quickly set up a system that can process
        any JATS instance document, regardless of what flavor or version that instance
        document conforms to.  This is difficult to do, because each flavor and each
        version of the JATS is distributed as a separate, flattened Zip file which
        includes the bundled version of all of the files needed for that particular
        set.  For example, the <link
          xlink:href='ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/archive_dtd/books/2.3/book-dtd-2.3.zip'>books
          2.3 DTD Zip file</link> includes all of the
        books-specific modules, as well as all of the shared modules, and even
        the xhtml and mathml2 library modules.
      </para>
      <para>
        For each flavor/version of interest, it is necessary to download and extract
        the Zip file, and then manually tweak the provided OASIS catalog file for
        that set, and then point your XML tool set to use that catalog
        file.
        Because there are so many different tag set bundles, it would be quite
        time-consuming to configure a system that is able to use them all.
        This is not seen as a problem, because this is not the primary
        use-case that the NLM site is designed to serve.
        They provide stand-alone bundles specifically so that a user who
        is interested in only, for example, Publishing 2.3, can download that version
        and not be confused by all of the others (Jeff Beck, personal communication,
        3/22/2011).
      </para>
      <para>
        But if someone is interested in configuring a system that can
        understand and process any JATS instance document; either for the purposes
        of evaluating JATS, or so that they can exchange documents with other
        organizations, it would be quite difficult.
      </para>
      <para>
        To address this use case, and to provide a basis for the JATSPack
        architecture, I have repackaged all of the JATS DTD modules as JATSPacks,
        put them into a single bundle, and made the
        repackaged versions available on JATSPAN.
        This base bundle is (optionally) installed automatically when you first
        run the <code>jatspan</code> client utility, as part of its setting up the
        JATSPack repository.
        See <link linkend='base-jatspacks'>
          Existing JATS DTDs are available as JATSPacks</link> below for details.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id='why-4'>
      <title>A publisher develops a new JATS customization</title>
      <para> Let's say that a publisher has a need to customize the JATS, in order to include
        domain-specific data within the source documents in their database. This is actually the
        primary use-case that JATSPack was designed to address, and this is the complement of
        <link linkend='why-1'>the first use case</link> described above.  That use case
        described customizations from the user's perspective, and this use case describes them
        from the author's perspective.
      </para>
      <para>
        There are a number of concerns that
        tend to make people reluctant to define customizations.  Among the most prominent of these
        is that a customization to the JATS might make their
        documents less portable.  This use case is discussed in detail in the
        <link linkend='custcomp'>Customizations and Compatibility</link> section, below.

      <title>EXPath Packaging - the basis for the JATSPack format</title>

      <para> JATSPack is an extension of the
        <link xlink:href="http://www.expath.org/modules/pkg/">EXPath
          Packaging System</link> (hereinafter EXPath-pkg, written by Florent Georges).
        EXPath-pkg is a simple, concise format for the packaging of files of various core
        XML technologies, including XML Schema, Relax NG, Schematron, NVDL, XSLT, XQuery, and
        XProc (<xref linkend='T'/>).
        It also provides a flexible extension mechanism which is exploited by JATSPack to define
        additional file types, and other requirements specific to its needs. </para>

      <para> As defined by EXPath-pkg, a package is a set of files that fulfill a common purpose.
        Each package has a globally unique name (which is a URI) and an abbreviated name (hereafter
        referred to as <emphasis role='bital'>abbrev</emphasis>), an NCName.
        <emphasis role='bital'>Abbrev</emphasis> values are case-insensitive, and, by convention,
        all lowercase. A component is one file within a package, and can be one of several different
        types. </para>

      <para> A package includes a package descriptor (similar to a JAR manifest file) which lists
        the package contents and top-level metadata about the package. This metadata includes the
        URI name, <emphasis role='bital'>abbrev</emphasis>, version number, and a list of dependencies.
        Finally, all the files of a
        package are arranged in a specified directory structure, and used to create a Zip file, which
        by convention is given a name based on the <emphasis role='bital'>abbrev</emphasis>, the version number,
        and a ".xar" extension. </para>

      <para> EXPath-pkg is an emerging standard which is already supported by several tools,
        including the eXist and Qizx XML databases, the Saxon XSLT and XQuery processor and the
        Calabash XProc processor. (Support in Saxon and Calabash is via third-party plugins.) It is
        also implemented as an open-source Java library, hosted as the
        <link xlink:href="http://code.google.com/p/expath-pkg/">expath-pkg</link> project

        Another source of
        inspiration for the JATSPack format was the
        <link xlink:href='http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/Customization/odds.xml'>One
          Document Does it all</link> (ODD) format of TEI.
        The ODD has very clean structure, which encourages literate programming (documentation
        and code in the same source document), examples of usage, clear separation of concerns, and
        best of all, encapsulation of all the relevant data into a single document with a
        standardized structure (<xref linkend="I"/>).
        The JATSPack format strives to be similar to ODD, and could even be
        thought of as encapsulating the library or customization in one document,
        if one expands the
        definition of "document" to include "Zip file" (which is quite reasonable). </para>

      <title>Overall structure of JATSPacks<footnote><para>As described above, some of the
        requirements for the JATSPack format derive from the fact that it is an extension
        of EXPath-pkg, and some are JATSPack-specific.</para></footnote></title>
      <para> As already mentioned, every JATSPack must have an
        <emphasis role='bital'>abbrev</emphasis> and a version number.  In JATSPack, in order
        to help ensure that the abbreviated names will be unique, they are composed of
        two parts, each of which is an NCName (by convention, all lowercase, and the underscore
        character should not be used in either part).
        These are separated by a forward slash in the package descriptor file, for example,
        "nlmjats/archiving". </para>
      <para>
        The name of the package file is specified to be
        <emphasis role="bital">abbrev</emphasis>-<emphasis role='bital'>ver</emphasis>.xar.
        When the two part <emphasis role="bital">abbrev</emphasis> is used in the package
        filename, the forward slash is translated into an underscore.  For example,
        "nlmjats_archiving-1.0.xar".
        The actual low-level format of the file is that of a
        Zip file, and the directory structure within that archive is as shown here<footnote>
          <para>The internal directory structure of JATSPack differs from that specified
          for EXPath-pkg, and is another area of incompatibility.  The main difference is the
          location of the package descriptor file, which is in the root directory for
          EXPath-pkg packages.  In JATSPack, it was moved to the package's content directory.
          This way, it is possible to unzip the packages directly onto the filesystem, without requiring any
          shuffling of the file locations.</para>

        Within the package contents directory are the EXPath-pkg descriptor file expath-pkg.xml,
        and optionally a README.txt file.  Also in this
        directory are an OASIS catalog file and one
        subdirectory for each of the main file types of the package. </para>
      <para> The expath-pkg.xml file format is described in <xref linkend="T"/>. Extensions to the file format, as

      <para> The top-level <code>&lt;package&gt;</code> element includes
        attributes that give the <emphasis role='bital'>abbrev</emphasis>,
        the package name (a URI), and the version of this package.
        The <code>@spec</code> attribute indicates the version of EXPath-pkg
        that this package descriptor conforms to. The <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element
        gives a human-readable title of the package. </para>
      <para> The <code>@jp:spec</code> attribute is a JATSPack extension to the
        EXPath-pkg package file format.  This attribute is required for all JATSPacks,
        and its value gives the version of the JATSPack specification that this
        package conforms to.
      </para>
      <para>
        Another JATSPack extension is the addition of the
        <code>&lt;rdf:Description&gt;</code> metadata section, which uses the XML
        vocabulary defined by <link xlink:href='http://dublincore.org/'>the Dublin Core
        Metadata Initiative</link> (DCMI) to allow authors to describe the package
        in more detail.
      </para>
      <para> EXPath-pkg allows zero-to-many <code>&lt;dependency&gt;</code> elements,
        each of which indicates a
        dependency of this package. In this example, we see that the
        <emphasis role='bital'>filesystem</emphasis> package depends on
        the JATS Archiving 3.0 base JATSPack. </para>
      <para> The <code>&lt;jp:catalog&gt;</code> element specifies the location of the
        OASIS catalog file that
        accompanies this package. Finally, the <code>&lt;xslt&gt;</code> element
        specifies the location of an

      <title>OASIS Catalog files</title>
      <para> Note that there are no individual entries in the package descriptor for the top-level
        DTD files of this <emphasis role='bital'>filesystem</emphasis>
        customization.  That's because these DTD modules are specified in the OASIS catalog
        file, and,
        following the principle of <link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</link>,
        are not duplicated in the
        descriptor. Resolution of public identifiers (FPIs) and system identifiers (URIs) to
        DTD modules within
        this package is delegated to the catalog file mechanism. </para>
      <para> An elided view of the OASIS catalog file accompanying this package is the following. </para>
      <programlisting>&lt;catalog xmlns=&quot;urn:oasis:names:tc:entity:xmlns:xml:catalog&quot;
         prefer=&apos;public&apos;&gt;

          uri=&quot;dtd/filesystem.dtd&quot;/&gt;
  ...
&lt;/catalog&gt;</programlisting>
      <para> This catalog file uses the <code>@uri</code> attribute with a relative URI value
        to specify the location of the main DTD included
        with this package. An important point here is that there is nothing special about this
        catalog file. It is usable by any system that can read OASIS catalog files, and does not
        depend on those systems' understanding the JATSPack format. </para>

      <title>Existing JATS DTDs, and selected Relax NGs, are available as JATSPacks</title>
      <para> The existing set of 34 complete DTDs of the JATS, as downloadable from the NLM
        <link xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/archive_dtd/">archive_dtd</link> and
        <link xlink:href='ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/jats/'>jats</link> FTP sites, has been
        repackaged as JATSPacks.  In addition, the latest NISO trial versions of the
        Relax NG schemas have been included in those JATSPacks.  (The older NLM JATS versions
        of the JATSPacks only include the DTDs.)  These can all be downloaded
        from JATSPAN as a single bundle.
        The DTDs include all seven flavors, and
        up to seven versions of each, going all the way back to version 1.0, and all the
        way up to the recently released NISO trial versions.
      </para>
      <para>
        As described in the use case "<link linkend="why-3">A publisher evaluates JATS for the first time</link>"
        above, each DTD version on the NLM FTP site is downloadable as a single Zip file which
        includes all of the
        files required for that version, including all the core files that the version
        depends on.  As mentioned, this is very suitable for, for example,
        a publisher or author who is interested in configuring a system
        capable of dealing with a specific flavor and version (for example, Article
        Authoring 3.0) of JATS.
        Unfortunately, however, this method of distribution makes it difficult to implement a
        single system that's capable of processing instance documents that conform to
        <emphasis role='ital'>any</emphasis> of the many different versions of JATS. </para>
      <para>
        Because each Zip file on the FTP site is a complete set of all of the files needed by
        an instance of the DTD, among the complete set of all flavors and versions, there is a lot
        of duplication of files.
        This leads to some ambiguity when many of these sets coexist on the
        same system at the same time. If the same public identifier is used in multiple catalog
        files on the
        system, and point to document instances which are not identical,
        it is difficult for someone
        configuring the system to sort out whether the differences are substantive, and if so,
        which is the canonical instance. </para>
      <para> The JATSPack base bundle eliminates this redundancy, factors shared modules out into a
        <emphasis role="bital" >core</emphasis> package, and cleans up a few inconsistencies.
        The result is a well-defined directory
        structure, with well documented dependencies. Each individual package comes with an OASIS
        catalog file that only has entries for the file in that particular module.  A top-level
        catalog file is provided that uses the <code>&lt;nextCatalog&gt;</code>
        element to include all of the others. </para>
      <para> These JATSPack versions of the schema are 100% compatible with those on the NLM site, and
        because of this, the JATSPack versions of the NISO DTDs are fully compliant implementations of
        the NISO standard<footnote>
          <para> When doing this work, I faced a question, and reached a conclusion, which
          might be controversial.
            Because I moved files into a different directory structure,
            but I wanted them to remain usable by systems without OASIS catalog files,
            using the relative system identifiers, I had to change these identifiers in the
            modules that reference the moved files. I also made other minor edits to reconcile
            cases where, for example, two different instances of a document were referred to by
            the same public identifier (FPI). I made these changes,
            without changing the FPIs, for those files that
            were changed. I think this is the right decision, for the following reason. The
            significance of an FPI is that any tool that resolves it correctly will get
            identical results. The FPI specifies a <emphasis>logical resource</emphasis> –- a
            DTD or an external parsed entity — not a <emphasis>specific byte
            sequence</emphasis>. With this change, the resolution of any given FPI will still
            result in the exact same entity replacement text,
            when all of the sub-entities are correctly resolved.  </para>
        </footnote>.
      </para>
      <para>
        The Relax NG Zip files downloadable from the NLM site do not include OASIS catalog files,
        and so to include these files in the JATSPacks, it was necessary to create entries
        for them.  This is discussed in more
        detail in <link linkend="namespaces-relaxng">Namespaces and Relax NG</link>, below.

        By itself, repackaging this library in this way could
        not be considered an improvement over the current deployment of this tool,
        as a Zip file.
        However, there are a few advantages. Since this package is on JATSPAN, it can be searched
        for and discovered on JATSPAN. The documentation can be browsed by anyone from the JATSPAN
        site, without downloading and extracting the package. Anyone using the <code>jatspan</code> client
        utility could install it automatically with the following simple command.
        <programlisting>jatspan install html/publishing-3.0-preview</programlisting>
        Anyone with an EXPath-pkg enabled system would have instant
        programmatic access to the XProc stylesheets and XSLT modules, through their import URIs.
        Normally this would require some integration effort, but with JATSPack, it is automatic.
      </para>
      <para> Furthermore, there are no disadvantages to packaging this way. The JATSPAN site allows
        anyone to download this package as a .zip file (exactly the same file as the .xar, but with
        a different extension), which can then be unzipped on the filesystem and used just as easily
        as before. </para>
      <para> Another advantage is that other JATSPacks, written by other authors, could
        declare a dependency on this package.  This would simplify the installation and
        integration of those later packages.  And this point makes a good segue to the next example.

      <title>EPub Transformation</title>
      <para> At the JATS-Con last year, Laura Kelly gave
        an excellent presentation
        on the EPUB format and a set of
        transformations for converting JATS documents into EPUB (<xref linkend="AD"/>).
      </para>
      <para> She wrote the transformations in standards-conforming, system independent, XSLT 2.0 and
        XProc. The effort to repackage this as a JATSPack was quite minimal, and involved basically
        the same steps as above. The <emphasis role='bital'>abbrev</emphasis> assigned to this JATSPack is
        "epub/jats-to-epub". </para>
      <para> This set of transformations uses the preview stylesheets described above. The original
        Zip file distribution of this library includes a copy of the XSLT files from the preview
        stylesheets that are used.
        In the JATSPack, those have been removed, and replaced with a
        dependency declaration in the package descriptor file.  The advantage of this is
      that users can avoid having two copies of the same library (the preview stylesheets)
      on their system at the same time.  In this simple example, it would not be
      a big problem.  But the problem of multiple copies of the same resources
      can get severe as the number of packages and libraries increases.</para>

    <section xml:id='accessible-tables'>
      <title>Accessible Tables Stylesheet</title>
      <para> The next example is not a JATSPack at all; it is an EXPath-pkg.
        My colleague Martin Latterner wrote a very nice XSLT stylesheet which takes as
        input an XHTML table. The stylesheet computes, for each table cell, which horizontal and
        vertical headers correspond to that cell. The stylesheet then adds classes to the cells and
        headers to explicitly encode the associations. </para>
      <para> This is necessary so as to properly code tables for compliance with Section 508 of the
        U.S. Rehabilitation Act of 1973, providing for accessibility to the disabled, in particular
        the visually impaired. With tables marked up like this, screen readers can assist visually
        impaired users by reading, for any given table cell, the headers associated with that cell.
        <xref linkend="atable"/> illustrates the result of this transformation.
      </para>
      <figure xml:id="atable">
        <title>Accessible Table Illustration</title>
        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>

        <caption>
          <para>Example of a table marked up with accessibility classes.
          The data cell pointed to by the mouse pointer (the blue cell) has several header cells
          associated with it.  Those header cells are highlighted in red.</para>
        </caption>
      </figure>
      <para> Given that tables can have very complicated structures, with multiple
        <code>@colspan</code> and
        <code>@rowspan</code> cells in different places, this is not a trivial algorithm.
        </para>
      <para> In addition to the XSLT, Martin also wrote a JavaScript module for testing. The
        JavaScript reacts to mouseover events, and causes the current cell and its associated
        header cells to be highlighted with a different background color, as shown in
        <xref linkend="atable"/>.
      </para>
      <para> This stylesheet provides a very specific bit of functionality,
        and is something that other users could benefit from, so it is suitable for
        packaging and putting on a public repository.
        However, since it operates on XHTML tables, and is not JATS specific, it is more
        appropriate to package it as an EXPath-pkg and to put it on <link xlink:href="http://cxan.org/">CXAN</link>
        (the Comprehensive XML Archive Network),
        so that is what we did. </para>
      <para> The reason this is included as an example in this paper is to illustrate the
        important fact that JATSPack systems are backwards-compatible with EXPath-pkg.
        Any system set up to use JATSPacks will also be able to install and use any of the
        EXPath-pkgs on CXAN. </para>
      <para> To use this particular accessible tables stylesheet, one would install the EXPath-pkg,
        and then simply import the stylesheet using the import URI defined in the package
        descriptor. It could be wrapped in an XProc step, or the template could be invoked directly
        from another stylesheet. </para>

    <section xml:id='taxpub'>
      <title>TaxPub</title>
      <para> TaxPub is a customization of JATS in DTD form, which was described
        in a paper presented at last year's JATS-Con (<xref linkend="D"/>).
        The extension
        allows for the encoding of literature of biological taxonomy, and in particular, taxonomy
        treatments, which are blocks of well-structured markup with very specific semantics. It is
        maintained as
        <link xlink:href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/taxpub/">an
          open-source project on SourceForge</link>, with
        <link xlink:href="http://taxpub.sourceforge.net/taxpub-doc/">documentation</link> on the
        project home page. </para>
      <para> The TaxPub customization comprises a set of DTD files, which defines a set of
        new element names with a "tp:" pseudo-namespace-prefix (e.g. "tp:taxon-treatment"). </para>
      <para> This has been repackaged as a JATSPack and put on the JATSPAN website. The following is
        a summary of the steps involved: </para>
      <para>
        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              Assigned a unique <emphasis role='bital'>abbrev</emphasis>: "taxpub/schema",
              and version:  "0.1".
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para> Created the specified directory structure:

    schema/
        0.1/
            dtd/
            doc/
            samples/</programlisting>
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para> Moved the TaxPub DTD-specific .dtd and .ent files into the dtd directory. There
              are five of these.
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para> Removed the no-namespace-prefix versions of the DTD. These have been deprecated.
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para> Fixed the relative system identifiers in each of the TaxPub modules so that they
              reflect the fixed directory structure of a JATSPack installation. This is similar to
              what was done for the base JATS modules. It is not strictly necessary, but has the
              benefit that the same modules can be used on systems that don't support OASIS catalog
              files. </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para> Fixed the DOCTYPE declarations of the sample files. As downloaded, the included
              sample files' DOCTYPE declarations did not use formal public identifiers (FPIs),
              and used only relative system
              identifiers. For example:
              <programlisting>&lt;!DOCTYPE article SYSTEM "../tax-treatment-NS0.dtd"&gt;</programlisting>
              These were changed to use FPIs, and the relative system identifier was changed to
              reflect the new directory structure.  For example:
              <programlisting>&lt;!DOCTYPE book PUBLIC
      "-//TaxonX//DTD Taxonomic Treatment Publishing DTD v0 20100105//EN"
      "../dtd/tax-treatment-NS0.dtd"&gt;</programlisting>
              This allows these sample files to be used in the automated tests. They also now serve
              as examples of the proper DOCTYPE declaration to use for instance documents of these
              types. If it is desired that documents of this type be easily exchangeable between
              systems, then it is crucial that document instances be properly self-identifying.
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para> Created a catalog.xml file in the base "taxpub" directory. This cross references
              each of the defined FPIs in this customization to it&apos;s correct module in the
              package. For example:
              <programlisting>&lt;catalog xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:entity:xmlns:xml:catalog"
         prefer=&apos;public&apos;&gt;
  &lt;public publicId="-//TaxonX//DTD Taxonomic Treatment Publishing DTD v0 20100105//EN"
          uri="dtd/tax-treatment-NS0.dtd"/&gt;

          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para> Created a new README.txt file, adapted from the existing one, and adding a bit of

          <listitem>
            <para> Zipped the result, gave it the name
              <emphasis role="bold">taxpub_schema-0.1.xar</emphasis>, and then uploaded it to the
              JATSPAN website. </para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
      </para>

      <para> To see the advantages of this packaging format, let's consider a very specific
        use-case. Suppose that I am a user who works with the oXygen XML editor, and
        I find that I have a need to read, edit and validate TaxPub files. </para>

      <para> If TaxPub were not packaged in a JATSPack, the process of adding support to oXygen
        would not be difficult, but would require a little bit of expertise and some time. I would
        have to download the Zip file, unpack it, and read the README file to see if there are any
        specific instructions I needed to worry about. Then I would find a place for it to reside on
        my filesystem and move the files there. The tricky bit is then to set up oXygen to
        understand the public identifer, and have it retrieve the correct DTD. I could either add an entry to my
        own personal catalog file (if I have one), add it to oXygen's master catalog file,
        or set up a "document type association" inside oXygen. </para>

      <para>
        Now let's suppose instead that I will use the JATSPack version of TaxPub.
        Of course, there is a bit of
        up-front configuration required, to set up a JATSPAN repository and point
        oXygen to it.  But that is a one-time operation, which then allows me instant access
        to any number of JATSPacks.  Also, this one-time setup is
        actually quite trivial, and easier than installing the support for the single TaxPub
        document type as described above.  The setup involves two steps:
        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para> Installing the JATSPAN software, and running it for the first time.
              This establishes a JATSPAN repository on the local filesystem. </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para> Telling oXygen where to find the master catalog file of the JATSPAN repository,
              by adding an entry in the "XML Catalog" preferences box. Note that
              <emphasis role="ital">any</emphasis> tool that is
              able to use OASIS catalog files could be pointed to this JATSPAN master catalog
              file, and would have the automatic ability to reference all of the schema files
              of all of the installed JATSPacks. </para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
      </para>
      <para> After the initial setup is done, to install support for TaxPub as a JATSPack,
        I need to enter one command:
        <programlisting>jatspan install taxpub/schema</programlisting>
      </para>
      <para> That is it — everything else is done automatically. When the TaxPub JATSPack is
        downloaded, a <code>&lt;nextCatalog&gt;</code> entry is added to the JATSPAN repository master catalog
        file, so oXygen instantly resolves any public identifiers defined by TaxPub. After entering the above
        command, I can validate and process TaxPub documents in oXygen. </para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section xml:id='custcomp'>
    <title>Customizations and Compatibility</title>
    <para> The original motivation for developing
      the JATSPack specification was to devise a means to package schema
      customizations together with software libraries that allow users to transform documents to and
      from the new schema. This is still, perhaps, the primary use-case. </para>
    <para> There is an ongoing sea change in the way that scientific research is published and
      presented. The lines between traditional definitions of media types, such as journal articles,
      books, wikis, blog posts, presentations, etc., are continually getting blurred
      (<xref linkend="G"/>). This implies
      that the number of different types of content included with scientific publications is growing
      rapidly. Often it is most appropriate to include disparate types of data with the original
      source documents, and that means either customizing the JATS schema, or providing some other
      means of including it, such as (for example) using the flexible
      <link xlink:href='http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/0.4/n-6pe0.html'><code>&lt;named-content&gt;</code></link>
      elements, and adding appropriate layer validation. </para>

    <para> The TaxPub example illustrates that the JATSPack/JATSPAN infrastructure can facilitate
      interchange of documents and data between organizations. A common theme overheard at last
      year's JATS-Con was that often, individual publishers' versions of their JATS DTDs
      are not interchangeable. In other words, PMC's version of JATS is not the same as
      Highwire's, even if they nominally use the same flavor and version of the tag
      suite. With a small amount of up-front work to resolve discrepancies and repackage
      customizations, this interchange problem can be helped, if not solved. </para>
    <para> The TaxPub example also serves to illustrate that the cost of doing compatible
      customizations need not be high. This can lead to easier reuse of existing XML
      vocabularies. The XML
      landscape is vast, and vocabularies have been defined for wide array of specialized
      topic domains — biological taxonomy is just one example.
      As mentioned previously, and as TaxPub illustrates, often it is very
      appropriate and beneficial to mix markup from other vocabularies directly into
      the instance documents. If the customization is deployed as a JATSPack, then one
      could make the customization without having to worry quite so much about breaking
      compatibility with existing systems, and the ability to exchange documents. </para>

    <para> But often one wants to do more with a document than just validate it, and that
      is where the true power of EXPath-pkg, and by extension JATSPack, lies.
      Customizations can also be packaged
      with software libraries in XProc, XQuery, and XSLT, that allow users to transform documents to
      and from the new schema. This would facilitate making forwards-compatible schema
      customizations. </para>

    <para>
      First, let's review what is meant by backwards and forwards compatibility, in the
      context of document schemas.  For this, I highly recommend
      <xref linkend="M"/>.  In a nutshell, backwards compatibility means that existing
      (version A) documents can be used by new XML processing systems, and forwards
      compatibility means that newer documents (version B) can be
      used by existing processing systems.
    </para>

    <para> A very successful model of forwards compatibility, that we are
      all familiar with, is the "must ignore" pattern of extensibility of HTML.
      This stipulates that HTML renderers must ignore any tags that they don't understand. In
      effect, this is a forwards-compatibility extension substitution rule. It allows future
      designers to customize the HTML schema, adding elements and attributes, while being able to
      predict how document instances in the new schema will be processed by old systems. The "must
      ignore" rule is one substitution rule, but it is very limited. If designers could include a
      set of transformations with the new schema, then those designers could define their own
      substitution rules. </para>

    <section xml:id='taxpub-rocks'>
      <title>TaxPub as an example of customization</title>
      <para> TaxPub serves as a good example of this type of customization. It includes many new
        elements that deal specifically with taxonomy treatments, and thus introduces
        the problem of forwards compatibility:
      </para>
      <para>
        <blockquote>
          <para>
            TaxPub, as an
            extension, provides semantics beyond what is available in the base DTD through creating
            newly named elements - thus lending itself to domain-specific application. However, TaxPub
            instances may not be easily processed by applications already familiar with the Publishing
            DTD.
          </para>
          <attribution><xref linkend="D"/></attribution>
        </blockquote>
      </para>
      <para>
        This problem could be addressed by writing a set of XSLT stylesheets and including them
        with the TaxPub JATSPack. These stylesheets would transform the new elements into
        plain-old-JATS. This would make it easier for third-party systems to install meaningful and
        useful support for TaxPub documents. Unlike the "must ignore" rule, the substitution rules
        written in XSLT could provide for richer markup in the result document, displaying the new
        content in visually distinctive ways, and perhaps even preserving the semantic content by
        means of special attribute keywords (for example). </para>
      <para> Designing a customization that is both forwards and backwards compatible, and
        compatible with other already-existing schema, is not trivial.
        With the JATSPack format, and a set of examples and detailed how-to
        instructions, some of the work required can be made
        easier.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id='style-rocks'>
      <title>Style checkers</title>

      <para> The definition of "customization" can be
        broad. A customization does not necessarily include a new DTD (or Relax NG or XSD schema).
        Customizations are often implemented as the addition of layered validation implemented
        in, for example, Schematron, that imposes a set of style rules that are more specific to a
        particular organization's use of the JATS. Sometimes these validation rules are coded
        simply as XSLT stylesheets that are applied to instance documents, and return a predefined
        report format. </para>
      <para> According to <xref linkend="A"/>, the results of a survey of publishers indicated that,
        "Half of the respondents said that they impose rules other than schema validation on their
        content." </para>
      <para> Since JATSPack supports Schematron, XSLT, and other formats, there is no reason that
        these sorts of style checkers couldn't also be packaged as JATSPacks and made available
        to third parties. Since JATSPack/JATSPAN imposes rules on versioning and the uniqueness
        of identifiers, it can help to safeguard against incompatibilities that can result
        from ad-hoc sharing of these sorts of libraries. </para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id='namespaces-relaxng'>
      <title>Namespaces and Relax NG</title>
      <para> JATSPack can also ease the migration away from DTDs and
        towards Relax NG for JATS schema. There are several reasons why this
        is desirable. DTDs do not properly support XML namespaces, and so hamper
        interoperability. Using namespaces will allow third parties to create customizations without
        having to worry so much about name clashes that can result from mixing vocabularies.
      </para>
      <blockquote><para>
        "The major design point of XML namespaces is to allow decentralized extensions." </para>
        <attribution><xref linkend="M"/></attribution>
      </blockquote>
      <para> That decentralized customizations and extensions occur is a fact.
        I don't think anyone would argue that
        decentralized customizations is a bad thing, or should be prohibited (even
        if that were possible).
        Yet, an inherent problem is that
        they can be difficult to manage and control.
        The JATSPAN infrastructure is designed to adapt to
        this decentralization, while at the same time providing specifications and imposing
        requirements, such that the proliferation of new schema doesn't become a problem.
        It does this by requiring that the formal public identifiers (FPIs) and URIs used to identify resources are
        well defined and unique, and also by virtue of its fixed directory structure, ensuring
        that separate individual JATSPacks fit together on the same system without clashing.
      </para>

      <para> Invoking the TaxPub customization as an example again, in the paper given at JATS-Con
        last year, the author describes some of the inherent difficulty of working with DTDs:
      </para>
      <blockquote>
        <para>
          The lack of robust namespace support in DTD removed the option of importing external
          schemas into TaxPub. This would make synchronization less onerous, for example, were it
          decided to include Darwin Core elements in TaxPub. It also would enable the inclusion of XML
          data in TaxPub instances themselves rather than on linking to them as external documents.
        </para>
        <attribution><xref linkend="D"/></attribution>
      </blockquote>

      <para>
        There are other reasons for recommending the use of Relax NG over DTDs, and an
        entire paper could be written on just that topic.
      </para>
      <para>
        However, there are two problems that must be overcome before Relax NG schemas
        can be used easily for JATS documents.
        The first is the lack of URI names for these
        Relax NG resources, and the second is that there is no standard way for documents to
        identify the Relax NG schema to which they conform.
      </para>
      <para>
        The first problem, the lack of URI names, is inherent in the current JATS
        infrastructure.  Relax NG schema are identified by URIs,
        and not FPIs.  In other words, URIs are used as the names of
        these resources, and there is no other name.  That this is a problem was
        eloquently described by Norman Walsh in his blog post from 2004 titled,
        "On the Web, My Name
        is 266 North Pleasant Street" (<xref linkend="AB"/>).  The current
        <link xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2003/webarch-20031128/">recommendations
        of the W3C</link> lead inexorably to the choice that new resources, such
        as Relax NG files, should be identified by absolute, canonical, persistent,
        and stable HTTP URIs.
      </para>
      <para>
        NLM has declined to issue such URIs for these resources.  They are worried about
        the potential for excessive server traffic driven by automated tools that
        process these URIs, similar to <link
          xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/blog/systeam/2008/02/08/w3c_s_excessive_dtd_traffic/">the
          experience of the W3C</link>.
      </para>
      <para>
        Without these URI identifiers, the Relax NG schema cannot be referenced in the
        instance documents in a clear, unambiguous way.  And as mentioned before,
        crucial to interchange of document instances is that they identify themselves.
      </para>

      <para>
        With the JATSPack/JATSPAN architecture, I have attempted to address this problem
        in the following ways.
      </para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            First of all, JATSPack, since it is based on EXPath-pkg, supports the
            inclusion of Relax NG XML and compact-notation files.  These should reside
            in the "rng" and "rnc" subdirectories of the package root, respectively.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Every JATSPack is assigned a name, which is an absolute URI.  This includes
            the base JATS packages.  For these, I assigned HTTP URI names that use the
            "jatspan.org" domain.  For example, the JATSPack implementation of the NISO
            trial version of the Article Authoring schema, version 0.4, has the name
            "http://jatspan.org/jatspacks/nisojats/articleauthoring/0.4".
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            The OASIS catalog files included with each JATSPack includes a
            <code>&lt;rewriteURI&gt;</code> entry which allows the identification of
            any resource within the JATSPack by using an absolute URI starting with
            the URI of the JATSPack.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            This provides a <emphasis>de facto</emphasis> canonical absolute URI
            name for each of these resources.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            JATSPAN may serve these resources from these absolute URIs, but may not.
            That decision is TBD.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Regardless, that URI can be safely used to identify these resources
            within instance documents.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>
        An example should make this clear.  The <link
          xlink:href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/articleauthoring/">NISO-JATS
          0.4 version of the Article Authoring</link> Relax NG schema is
        downloadable from the <link
          xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/jats/articleauthoring/0.4/">NLM FTP
          site</link>.  The Zip file does not include an OASIS catalog file.  The schema
        resource itself does not have a canonical URI name.
      </para>
      <para>
        While repackaging this as a JATSPack, I assigned a URI name to this package
        of "http://jatspan.org/jatspacks/nisojats/articleauthoring/0.4".  I added the following
        <code>&lt;rewriteURI&gt;</code> entry to the OASIS catalog
        file for this package.
        <programlisting>&lt;rewriteURI uriStartString="http://jatspan.org/jatspacks/nisojats/articleauthoring/0.4/"
            rewritePrefix="/"/&gt;</programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
        In effect, this assigns a URI name to the master Relax NG schema
        file of this package, and that name is
        "http://jatspan.org/jatspacks/nisojats/articleauthoring/0.4/rng/JATS-articleauthoring0.rng".
        Please feel free to use this name in any context, to refer to this resource.
        As mentioned above, JATSPAN might serve this resource at that URL, but might not;
        it is not guaranteed.
      </para>
      <para>
        The second problem is that there is no standard, agreed upon way for instance
        documents to identify themselves as conforming to a particular Relax NG
        schema.  The philosophy behind this fact is that schema validation should
        be a separate process that is not specified by the instance documents.  In
        other words, the idea is that the system, and not the document, should
        decide what schema to apply, and that for a given document, any of a number
        of schema might be applied, depending on the context.
      </para>
      <para>
        This is a nice theory, but in practice it has impeded the adoption of
        Relax NG in this particular domain.
      </para>
      <para>
        The oXygen XML editor defines a processing instruction (PI) that can be used
        within an instance document.  For example, given the URI described above,
        an instance documents could now use this PI to identify itself as a document
        conforming to this Relax NG schema:
        <programlisting>&lt;?oxygen RNGSchema="http://jatspan.org/jatspacks/niso-authoring/0.4/rng/JATS-articleauthoring0.rng"
         type="xml"?&gt;</programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
        This is very processor-specific, and therefore is not a good general solution.
      </para>
      <para>
        Perhaps the most straightforward way of making the association is by using
        a namespace on the root node of the document.  But the immediate problem
        with this is that the NISO-JATS Relax NG schemas will fail if any non-null
        namespace is given on the root node of any document.
      </para>
      <para>
        Solving this particular problem is out of the scope of this paper, but I
        would like to suggest that the Relax NG schema files delivered with JATS
        be modified to specify a canonical namespace for each of the document types.
        Failing that, this could always be done as an independent customization, in
        a separate JATSPack.
      </para>

  <section xml:id='more'>
    <title>More JATSPack features and recommendations</title>

    <section xml:id='doc'>
      <title>Documentation</title>

      <para> It is recommended that each JATSPack includes documentation, including structured
        documentation of any schema extensions. The exact format of this documentation is
        TBD, but the goal is that it should seamlessly integrate with existing JATS
        documentation. That is, the documentation should simply "plug in" to the documentation
        provided by the JATSPacks that come before it in the dependency tree. For example,
        hyperlinks to element or attribute descriptions, between the documentation for the various
        packs and between packs and the base JATS documentation, should resolve correctly. This
        aspect of the format is still under exploration. </para>
    </section>


    <section xml:id='code'>
      <title>Code libraries in XSLT, XQuery, and XProc</title>

      <para> JATSPacks can include library functions that pull out specific data from instance
        documents, so that the data is easily accessible from any JATSPack-enabled system. This is a
        way to provide different "views" on instance documents that could be appropriate for
        different purposes. JATSPacks that import and customize others could also extend the library
        functions defined in the imported packages. This is analogous to the object-oriented
        programming paradyme of creating a derived class from a parent class, and overriding or
        extending certain methods. </para>
      <para> As described above under "Customizations and Compatibility", in order to facilitate
        interchange of document instances, authors of JATSPacks that customize the schema are
        encouraged to provide a stylesheet for conversion to and from the "standard JATS". </para>
      <para> Also, for these customization JATSPacks, authors are encouraged to supply XSLT
        stylesheets that import and extend the Journal Publishing Preview Stylesheets. In this way,
        a complete preview stylesheet for the new JATS customization would be available for use,
        instantly upon installation of the new JATSPack. If the stylesheet which converts to
        "standard JATS" is provided, then the implementation of this preview stylesheet is trivial
        — it is just the baseline preview stylesheet applied to the output of the "standard JATS"
        stylesheet. </para>
    </section>


    <section xml:id='samples'>
      <title>Sample files and automated tests</title>
      <para> In order to enable interchange of documents and of the software that processes them,
        instance documents must be self-identifying. Among the recommendations for proper JATSPacks
        which supply DTD customizations, sample files should be included which have the appropriate
        DOCTYPE declaration for that customization, which use the correct formal public identifer
        (FPI). The <code>jatspan</code> client
        utility, when installing a new JATSPack, performs automatic tests, which include validation
        of each of the sample files. In addition to validating them in place, this step includes a
        test in which each sample file is copied to a separate temporary directory and then
        validated. This ensures that the FPI is used to resolve the DTD, not the system identifier,
        and guarantees that instance documents modeled after the JATSPack sample files can be
        exchanged between different systems. </para>
      <para> Additionally, any type of JATSPack can include its own predefined test in the form of
        an XQuery function which returns a boolean true (pass) or false (fail). Since all of the
        resources inside a JATSPack are addressable by using URIs relative to the "name" URI of the
        JATSPack itself (given in the package descriptor), these test could operate on the included
        sample files, to verify the integrity of the package as a whole, and that the software
        library operates correctly on the target system. </para>

          <listitem>
            <para> Anyone can browse the list of JATSPacks, see their descriptions (which are
              extracted automatically from the package descriptors) and download those of interest.
              JATSPacks can be downloaded in one of two forms (that differ only in the filename
              extension): XAR files (which have the .xar extension) or Zip files (which have the

          <listitem>
            <para> Registered users can upload JATSPacks. These are unpacked on the server,
              automatically checked for consistency (for example, that the package descriptor file
              is valid) and instantly made available to other users for browsing and download.
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para> The site automatically runs the automated document-generation tools XSLStyle and
              xqDoc over the XSLT and XQuery JATSPack components, respectively, and makes the
              generated documentation instantly available on the site. </para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </para>
      <para> The site, in its alpha incarnation, is implemented as a set of Perl CGI scripts
        based on the <link xlink:href="http://www.catalystframework.org/">Catalyst web
        framework</link>.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id='jatspan-client'>
      <title>jatspan client program</title>
      <para> I would like emphasize again that JATSPacks are usable on any system without any
        special infrastructure. Downloading the package as a Zip file and extracting it to the local
        filesystem could be done exactly the way it is done now, and the included schema,
        documentation, and library files are just as usable. </para>
      <para> However, there are additional advantages to setting up a local repository and using the
        <code>jatspan</code> client program to manage it.
        The <code>jatspan</code> client is a simple program that users can download
        and install. The interface is through the command line, and it is
        implemented as a Perl script.
      </para>
      <para> When it is run for the first time, it will ask for a location to create the local
        <code>jatspan</code> repository. This is a directory on the local filesystem, which is the root directory
        to which downloaded JATSPacks are extracted. The client program then creates this directory
        and writes a <code>jatspan</code> master OASIS catalog file to it, as well as performing
        a few other setup tasks. </para>
      <para> The master OASIS catalog file can be used by tools, such as oXygen, to resolve
        identifiers defined within JATSPacks. These XML tools should be set up to point to this
        catalog file. As described above, this only needs to be done once, and from that point on,
        those tools will be able to resolve any identifiers defined by any JATSPack that is
        installed on the local system. </para>
      <para> Also as part of setup, the user can choose whether or not to download and install the
        repackaged base JATS bundle, described in
        <link linkend="base-jatspacks">Existing JATS DTDs are available as JATSPacks</link> above.
        The advantage to choosing to install it is
        that all of the flavors and versions of JATS will then be available immediately.
        But it is
        also possible to use the system without installing the base JATSPacks.
        Because of the system of
        resolving dependencies automatically, the required base JATS DTD files will be available as
        soon as the first JATSPack is installed.  In other words, they could also be installed
        one-by-one, as the need arises. </para>
      <para> After setup, the client can install any desired JATSPack by entering the command
        <programlisting>jatspan install <emphasis role='bital'>abbrev</emphasis></programlisting>
        This will install the
        latest version of the JATSPack indicated, along with all of its dependencies. It will also
        update the master catalog file with <code>&lt;nextCatalog&gt;</code> entries,
        pointing to the catalog
        file provided with each new installed JATSPack. </para>
      <para> As an implementation detail, note that the JATSPAN server uses many of the same Perl
        functions as the <code>jatspan</code> client, to perform many of the same sorts of tasks.
        For example,
        when a user uploads a JATSPack to the server, the server "installs" this JATSPack in its
        repository, in a manner quite complementary to the operation performed when users download
        JATSPacks to their client machine.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id='future-possibilities'>
      <title>Future possibilities</title>

      <para> The next-phase implementation of JATSPAN will copy the Servlex/eXist architecture of
        the CXAN site as described in <xref linkend="S"/>.
        Besides the obvious
        advantage that this is a more flexible architecture, it can take advantage of the XML
        resources that the site is designed to serve, it can also provide a model for how to set up
        a flexible, extensible XML processing toolchain for organizations that need to develop one.
        This architecture is dubbed the JATSPack Application Framework, or JATSPAF. The following
        figure shows the relationships among all of these entities. </para>

          <listitem>
            <para> JATSPacks could be usable directly off of JATSPAN, without installing them to a
              local machine. This would involve pointing an XML tool at the master OASIS catalog
              file on JATSPAN, which includes <code>&lt;nextCatalog&gt;</code> entries for all
              of the JATSPacks
              uploaded to date. This would allow users to run tests and use a JATSPack without
              installing it locally, for evaluation purposes, in the same way that they now can
              browse the JATSPack documentation before downloading the package. </para>

          <listitem>
            <para> JATSPAN could provide instance document tools, such as a validator and document

              the JATS schema (including any customized version implemented as a JATSPack), and
              validate it and/or preview it. These are similar to the services
              provided by the PMC <link

    <title>Conclusions</title>
    <para> Throughout this paper, I have touted the potential benefits of the JATSPack format
      and the JATSPAN site.  These benefits include:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para> making it easier to deploy
          systems that support a wide variety of XML formats;</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para> facilitating the creation,
          distribution, and maintenance of schema customizations and libraries of code that
          would be associated with them;</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para> allowing developers to easily exchange these customizations and libraries; and
        thereby</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para> facilitating the exchange of scientific documents and data, while preserving their
          rich semantic content. </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      To fully realize the possible benefits, much more work would
      be required.  However, I
      believe that establishing this specification and web site is a good step in the
      right direction.
    </para>

    <para>
      One of the goals of this proposal is to help publishers and digital repositories
      to produce XML systems that are more open.  Sharing of schema customizations and
      libraries would reduce the amount of duplicated
      effort that is expended when adapting systems to different XML document types.
      In order to acheive this goal,
      this format will have to obtain some measure of support within the publishing
      community.
      The challenge lies in persuading
      systems architects that this format would benefit them,
      so that they will expend the effort to adapt their systems to support it.
      By providing a "starter set" of JATSPacks, as described in the examples section,
      I hope that I've shown that:  A) creating JATSPacks is easy, and B) sharing JATSPacks
      will benefit everybody.
    </para>

    <para>
      Of course, there is nothing inherently JATS-specific in the JATSPack format.
      The ways in which JATSPack extends EXPath-pkg, as described
      <link linkend='whence'>above</link>, are primarily to add schema of various formats,
      sample documents, documentation, and OASIS catalog files.  It would be nice if
      these extensions could be rolled into the EXPath-pkg specification itself.  That might
      eventually obviate the need for the JATSPAN website; it could be merged with CXAN.
      Whether that would help or hurt the cause of getting the format adopted is
      anybody's guess.
